<p>All print design, such as the Invitations, RSVP cards, Wedding Favour tags and Printed Board mounted on the easel were designed by myself using Adobe InDesign.</p>
<p>The website is a custom WordPress theme, built using HTML5 and Sass. A custom login form was created to be shown on the homepage, guests would log-in to their own account to view venue information and to RSVP online.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Website is no longer available online</p>
