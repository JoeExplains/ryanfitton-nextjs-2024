<p>This is a static HTML site with no CMS. The main reason for this was the content on the pages would rarely change, there would also be no pages such as News that would require dynamic content &ndash; The only exception for this is a custom contact form built in PHP which will send submission emails and insert the data into a MySQL database.</p>
<p>Created using Bootstrap v2, with the stylesheets built in LESS which are then compiled into a standard CSS format.</p>
<p>The contact form on the site is a custom-developed PHP form. This is built-upon the PHPMailer library.</p>
