<p>The main tasks for managing this website consisted of; adding news posts, and updating page content and SEO.</p>
<p>As this website was not managed by a CMS, all changes had to be done manually via HTML editing.</p>
<p>Monthly SEO meetings helped increase the search ranking positions, and allowed for discussions for changing page content.</p>
