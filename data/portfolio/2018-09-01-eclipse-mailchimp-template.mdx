<p>Mailchimp allows templates to be uploaded as long as they include Mailchimp specific tags.</p>
<p>Whilst I have created HTML emails before, this was the first time using Mailchimp. Their documentation page was very handy, and in no time I had a working example which included different &lsquo;elements&rsquo; which could be selected in Mailchimp.</p>
<p>To ensure the HTML email would look acceptable in client&rsquo;s email clients/browsers I used Litmus to test for each device which was being targeted; these were: Microsoft Outlook 2007+, Thunderbird, iOS Mail and Gmail smartphone apps, along with a variety of web-based clients (Gmail, AOL and Yahoo!).</p>
<p>The email is responsive and works in a variety of email clients. I used a commonly known email testing service named &lsquo;<a href="https://litmus.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Litmus</a>&lsquo; which allowed me to fix any bugs I came across.</p>
