<p>I chose a style which had not been used before, something unique and to be easily noticed by the customer. I believe having a large dark background accomplished this, especially when the advert is printed next to a facing white content page.</p>
<p>Whilst this advert did not go &lsquo;live&rsquo; there are parts which have been used in other projects since, noticeably the bright blue heading colour and icons.</p>
<p>Created whilst working at Eclipse Legal Systems. Software used: Adobe InDesign and FontAwesome.</p>
