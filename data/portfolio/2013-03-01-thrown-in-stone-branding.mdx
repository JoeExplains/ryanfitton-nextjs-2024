<p>The logo was designed using sand, stone and earth colours to represent the colours of the products which the company produces. The logo was also designed with a two colour and black and white version.</p>
<p>A brand guidelines document was created in order for the brand to have a consistent style. The manual describes the usage of the logo and correct typefaces, as well as other information.</p>
<p>Lastly, other items were produced such as Business Cards, Document Templates and Bag Tags.</p>
