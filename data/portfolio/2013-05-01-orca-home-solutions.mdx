<p>The solution was to build a static brochure style website which has further detail on the services offered. A contact form was added to make it easy for customers to contact the company for any further enquires.</p>
<p>I was passed design files for this website by my&nbsp;colleagues&nbsp;and it was my task to&nbsp;efficiently&nbsp;build this website.</p>
<p>This is a static website, built with HTML5 and standard CSS. jQuery and SlidesJS libraries were used for the image gallery carousel.</p>
