<p>The brief was to create a brightly designed advert that sstands-out from other companies.</p>
<p>I opted for a large heading on white shapes so that it stood out from the blue background. There was enough space for other relevant information, along with a call-out-box for other text.</p>
<p>Created whilst working at Eclipse Legal Systems, using InDesign with typefaces from Font&nbsp;Squirrel and imagery from iStockPhoto.</p>
