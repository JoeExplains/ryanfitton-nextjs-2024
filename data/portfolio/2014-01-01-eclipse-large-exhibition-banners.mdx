<p>The brief was to create a design which could be used as a &lsquo;backdrop&rsquo; for allocated stands, and something which would stand-out to prospective clients.</p>
<p>I went for a simple, grey-on-white backdrop with a blue strip (part of Eclipse&rsquo;s colour scheme), large easy to read text and three coloured boxes from the website which describes the company.</p>
<p>Created in InDesign, and printed by a third party company who I liaised with. There is an event photo of the banner being used&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6460434128495083521" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
