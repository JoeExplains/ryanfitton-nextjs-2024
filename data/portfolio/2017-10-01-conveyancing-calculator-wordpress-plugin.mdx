<p>As most clients would be running WordPress, I felt the best decision would be to be develop a WordPress plugin so the calculator could be easily integrated into a client&rsquo;s current website.</p>
<p>I used WordPress&rsquo; plugin development best practices, splitting code into separate files, custom function and database table names, etc.</p>
<p>Since October 2017, this plugin has undergone a few major changes such as adding new Fee and Value options, updates to Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT) and the recent Welsh Land Tax Transaction Residential (LTT) fees.</p>
<p>The plugin has been tested across multiple versions of WordPress from 4.6.1 up-to the current (at time of writing, Feb 2019) version of 5.0.3.</p>
