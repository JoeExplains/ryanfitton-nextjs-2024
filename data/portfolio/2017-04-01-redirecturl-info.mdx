<p>The back-end is written in PHP and works by having a domain pointed to&nbsp;this service&rsquo;s web-server IP address, with TXT records setup on the domain which tell the service which URL to used as the redirect destination.</p>
<p>The site uses PHP&rsquo;s <code class="language-php">dns_get_record</code> function and looks for the <code class="language-php">DNS_TXT</code> values for the supplied domain. It loops through the values, then finds the value for the key which begins with <code class="language-php">redirect_</code>, you can read the setup instructions on this projects page <a href="https://github.com/ryanfitton/redirecturl.info">here</a>.</p>
<p>The service is completely transparent to the end user, with only a few milliseconds of time spent on the redirect process.</p>
