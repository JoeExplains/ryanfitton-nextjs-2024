<p>&lsquo;Dynamic Web Design&rsquo; is a service provided to clients who would like to be up and running quickly with a website that can be customised to suit their needs.</p>
<p>As these were kept as pre-built templates, options have been added for clients to change their text colours, logo, content and images.</p>
<p>Each of the templates are responsive using Bootstrap v2. The stylesheets were built in LESS, which are then compiled into CSS3. Bootstrap&rsquo;s Javascript was used to handle the navigation menu, with Contact Form 7 being used for the website&rsquo;s contact form.</p>
<p>As these templates were being used as a demo site, these were incorporated into a WordPress multi-site. This allows you to login once, but with all sites linked together.</p>
<p>Unlike the other web design temaplates, this design features an &lsquo;Our services&rsquo; and &lsquo;Who we are?&rsquo; content area. To make this area easy to edit in the WordPress back-end, a custom WordPress plugin was developed which integrated with WordPress Custom Fields to show editable content areas.</p>
