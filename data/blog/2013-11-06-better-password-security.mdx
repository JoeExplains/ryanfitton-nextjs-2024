  On the 3rd October 2013 Adobe announced they suffered a major data breach as reported by{' '}
  <a href="http://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/10/adobe-to-announce-source-code-customer-data-breach/">
    Krebs on Security
  </a>
  . Recently security researchers have analysed the leaked passwords used by Adobe’s customers, a
  news article by{' '}
  <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/11/05/adobe_users_purloined_passwords_were_pathetic/">
    The Register
  </a>{' '}
  shows this information clearly.

  It turns out that 1.9 million users were using ‘123456’ and another 3.5 million were using
  ‘password’ as their password. These passwords should never be used. You should always use a long
  complicated password with uppercase, lowercase, numbers and special characters.
</p>
<p>
  Personally I use an online generator to generate a random password; and where possible I try to
  use 30 character random passwords for all the websites and online services I use. I then store
  this information in .txt documents and in a HTML page with a search box. These files are then
  stored in a <a href="http://www.truecrypt.org/">TrueCrupt</a> container with another unique master
  key.
</p>
<p>
  It can be a pain having to copy and paste the passwords to log in, other options available would
  be <a href="https://lastpass.com/">LastPass</a> or <a href="http://keepass.info/">KeePass</a>. As
  more and more people sign-up to services online it is hard to trust the encryption which the
  services offer; therefore it is vital to use a strong unique password for each service.
