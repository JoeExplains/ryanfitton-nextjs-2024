On the 3rd October 2013 Adobe announced they suffered a major data
breach as reported by  [Krebs on
Security](http://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/10/adobe-to-announce-source-code-customer-data-breach/)
. Recently security researchers have analysed the leaked passwords used
by Adobe's customers, a news article by  [The
Register](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/11/05/adobe_users_purloined_passwords_were_pathetic/)
  shows this information clearly.

It turns out that 1.9 million users were using '123456' and another 3.5
million were using 'password' as their password. These passwords should
never be used. You should always use a long complicated password with
uppercase, lowercase, numbers and special characters.

Personally I use an online generator to generate a random password; and
where possible I try to use 30 character random passwords for all the
websites and online services I use. I then store this information in
.txt documents and in a HTML page with a search box. These files are
then stored in a [TrueCrupt](http://www.truecrypt.org/) container with
another unique master key.

It can be a pain having to copy and paste the passwords to log in, other
options available would be [LastPass](https://lastpass.com/) or
[KeePass](http://keepass.info/). As more and more people sign-up to
services online it is hard to trust the encryption which the services
offer; therefore it is vital to use a strong unique password for each
service.
