<p>For about a year I have been using <a href="http://brackets.io/">Adobe Brackets</a> as my go-to code editor, previously I was using <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text 3</a>.</p>
<p>Whilst I still love Sublime Text the idea of Brackets being open-source and written in HTML, CSS and Javascript was something that got me excited.</p>
<p>However the <a href="https://github.com/jonschlinkert/sublime-monokai-extended">Monokai theme</a> that I gotten used to with Sublime Text was one of the main &#8216;must haves&#8217; I really wanted to have within Brackets. Whilst there already is a Monokai theme available for Brackets (<a href="https://github.com/Brackets-Themes/Monokai">here</a>), I wasn&#8217;t keen on some of the colours it used for syntax highlighting.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve made a copy of this theme and applied some changes. The edited theme is hosted on my Github account <a href="https://github.com/ryanfitton/monokai-theme-for-brackets">here</a>.</p>
<p>The theme has been released under the MIT license, so you&#8217;re free to take a copy and make any modifications.</p>
