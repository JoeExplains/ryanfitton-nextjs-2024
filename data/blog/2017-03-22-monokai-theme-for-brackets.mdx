For about a year I have been using [Adobe Brackets](http://brackets.io/) as my go-to code editor, previously I was using [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/).

Whilst I still love Sublime Text the idea of Brackets being open-source and written in HTML, CSS and Javascript was something that got me excited.

However the [Monokai theme](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/sublime-monokai-extended) that I gotten used to with Sublime Text was one of the main 'must haves' I really wanted to have within Brackets. Whilst there already is a Monokai theme available for Brackets ([here](https://github.com/Brackets-Themes/Monokai)), I wasn't keen on some of the colours it used for syntax highlighting.

I've made a copy of this theme and applied some changes. The edited theme is hosted on my Github account [here](https://github.com/ryanfitton/monokai-theme-for-brackets).

The theme has been released under the MIT license, so you're free to take a copy and make any modifications.
