This is a quick and simple backup script, specifically created for use with Online.net's 100GB FTP Storage, which is given for free when buying one of their dedicated servers.

The steps listed below can be found in my Backup script collection on GitHub here: [https://github.com/ryanfitton/lxc-mysql-tar-backup-script-collection](https://github.com/ryanfitton/lxc-mysql-tar-backup-script-collection)

The script below is simple, saves as 'sudo sh backup_files2ftp.sh' and fill out the 'Backup options', 'FTP Connection details', and your email address.

Run the script with `sudo sh backup_files2ftp.sh` (make sure the file is executable first).

All files within the specified directory will be archived as a .tar.gz file, then transferred using FTP to the remote server. Once the file has been confirmed it the file exists on the FTP server, it is deleted from the local server.

``` language-markup
#!/bin/bash

## Usage: backup_files2ftp.sh
##
## Make the script executable:
##   chmod +x backup_files2ftp.sh
##
## Run using:
##   sudo sh backup_files2ftp.sh


# Backup options
BACKUP_FILES='/'                        # Notes: '/' = Backup entire server. Change this for paticular files/folders.
BACKUP_SAVEPATH='/'                     # Notes: '/' = Server root folder. Used temporarily. Ensure folder already exists.
FILENAME_PREFIX='full-backup_'          # Prefix for the .tar.gz folder.

# FTP Connection details
FTP_SERVER='your_ftp_server'
FTP_USERNAME='your_username'
FTP_PASSWORD='your_password'
FTP_PORT=21
FTP_ARGUMENTS='-np'                     # Notes: '-n' = Do not attempt to autologin. '-p' = Enable passive mode.
CURL_FTP_ARGUMENTS='--ftp-pasv'         # Curl is used to verify the FTP upload. Notes: '' = Enable passive mode.

# Email confirmation details
EMAIL_TO='your_email_address'

**Note:** Using the standard FTP protocol is unsafe, your details will be passed in plaintext. However because Online.net's FTP backup service runs within their own network there is not much risk to myself. I do highly recommend using SFTP or FTPS, both will likely need modification of the script in-order to work properly.
