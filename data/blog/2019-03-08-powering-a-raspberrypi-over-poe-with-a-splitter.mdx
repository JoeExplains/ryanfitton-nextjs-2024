<p>I have recently picked up a Raspberry Pi Zero. Because of it&#8217;s size, it is small enough to fit about anywhere, but there isn&#8217;t always a free electrical socket nearby &#8211; however a PoE powered solution would be ideal.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve already heard there is an <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/poe-hat/">official PoE hat</a> but this can only be used with a <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Raspberry-Pi-Model-64-Bit-Processor/dp/B07BDR5PDW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?s=computers&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1551875082&amp;sr=1-5&amp;keywords=raspberry+pi+3+b+&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=ryanfittoncou-21&amp;linkId=2364b80115929d7798aa77c1c82b359c&amp;language=en_GB">Pi 3 Model B+</a>. The solution I have came up with (along with <a href="http://www.savagehomeautomation.com/projects/raspberry-pi-power-up-using-poe-power-over-ethernet.html">many</a> <a href="http://www.knutsel.org/2016/05/31/poe-pi-powering-a-raspberry-pi-with-power-over-ethernet/">other</a> <a href="https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/715/how-do-i-modify-my-raspberry-pi-to-be-powered-over-poe">people</a>) is to use a PoE splitter, this can split the power from the Ethernet cable to a 5V micro USB connection.</p>
<p>The PoE splitter I bought came from <a href="https://thepihut.com/products/adafruit-poe-splitter-with-microusb-plug-isolated-12w-5v-2-4-amp-ada3785">The Pi Hut</a>, the item came quickly and well packaged:</p>

<p>I am powering this from an 802.3af compatible PoE switch, namely the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/TP-LINK-TL-SG1008PE-Gigabit-Desktop-including/dp/B00CGY449G/ref=as_li_ss_tl?s=computers&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1551875131&amp;sr=1-4&amp;keywords=TP-LINK+TL-SG1008PE&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=ryanfittoncou-21&amp;linkId=d65ac2f2460c2e3060e7fdd162ba2994&amp;language=en_GB">TP-LINK TL-SG1008PE</a>. The installation is simple, simply connect the adaptor&#8217;s Ethernet and micro USB end into your Pi, then an Ethernet cable from your PoE switch to the PoE adaptor (I&#8217;m using the RPi Zero so the cables look messy, if you&#8217;re using a Model B variant it will look a lot neater):</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1140 " src="/static/img/blog/2019/03/IMG_20190308_121600-e1552047536346-1024x542.jpg" alt="" width="611" height="315" /></p>
<p>At first I was concerned if the wattage and amperage being supplied the adaptor would be insufficient. However the adaptor is rated to supply 5V power supply and up to 2.4 Amps, I&#8217;ve found in my tests that this was efficient for me needs, even with a keyboard and mouse connected via USB.</p>

<h4>Some other notes</h4>
<p>A word of warning: before finding the PoE adapter mentioned, my search originally led me to the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/TP-LINK-TL-PoE10R-TL-POE10R-PoE-Splitter/dp/B001PS4NWW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?s=computers&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1551875183&amp;sr=1-4&amp;keywords=TP-LINK+TL-POE10R&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=ryanfittoncou-21&amp;linkId=e7d9c6ffa52e0b0400b914ab7addf043&amp;language=en_GB">TP-LINK TL-POE10R</a> PoE splitter. In theory this would have worked (you can use a micro-switch to select a 5V output), and you would have had to find a barrel to USB cable adaptor.</p>
<p>Then I read this was a &#8216;non-isolated&#8217; adaptor, meaning you as soon as you plug in an isolated accessory/cable such as a HDMI cable which is connected to a TV the adaptor and Pi would turn-off.</p>
<p>A big thanks to James Young as he mentioned this originally on his <a href="https://blog.zencoffee.org/2015/11/tp-link-tl-poe10r-poe-splitter-ground-loop-issues/">blog</a>. If you&#8217;d like to see an example of this grounding issue, there is a video on YouTube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYd3RtooFxY">here</a>.</p>
