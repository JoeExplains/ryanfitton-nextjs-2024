<p>Google&#8217;s Webmaster Blog has recently posted about their #NoHacked campaign. This campaign is about giving website owners tips and tricks to ensure they don&#8217;t fall victim to a cyber attack. You can read about the campaign <a href="http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.co.uk/2015/07/nohacked-how-to-avoid-being-target-of.html">here</a>, I highly encourage you do &#8211; it gives some great advice.</p>
<p>Part of the advice they gave was about using <a href="https://www.google.com/alerts">Google Alerts</a> to notify you if there is any suspicious keywords on your website.</p>
<p>Using Google Alerts for this task is very simple. Simply go to <a href="https://www.google.com/alerts">Google Alerts</a> and setup an alert similar to:</p>
<p>site:example.com &#8220;spammy keyword here&#8221;</p>
<p>Change &#8216;example.com&#8217; to your domain, and change &#8216;spammy keyword here&#8217;  to the keyword you wish to be notified of, remember to leave the double quotes (&#8220;).</p>
<p>Your alert should look similar to this:</p>
<p><a href="/static/img/blog/2015/07/google-alerts-example.png"><img loading="lazy"  src="/static/img/blog/2015/07/google-alerts-example.png" alt="Example of using Google Alerts" width="704" height="292" srcset="/static/img/blog/2015/07/google-alerts-example.png 704w, /static/img/blog/2015/07/google-alerts-example-300x124.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 704px) 100vw, 704px" /></a></p>
