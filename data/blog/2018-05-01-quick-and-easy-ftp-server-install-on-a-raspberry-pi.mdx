For this setup, i'm using Ubuntu 16.04 running on a Raspberry Pi 3. The instructions should work correctly in Debian and Raspbian too -- in fact, you will probably have luck using these instructions on any Linux operating system, Raspberry Pi or not.

**Note:** FTP is not a secure protocol, I would recommend using SFTP for production environments.

1.  Login to SSH with `root`{.language-bash} or a user which has sudo permissions. The default Raspberry Pi `pi`{.language-bash} user should be okay.

2.  Update packages:

    ``` language-bash
    sudo apt-get update
    ```

3.  Create a new user, used only for FTP connections:

    ``` language-bash
    sudo adduser ftp-user
    ```

    Enter a password of your choice.

4.  Create a folder in `/root`{.language-bash}. This is where the USB HDD will be permanently mounted.

    ``` language-bash
    sudo mkdir /usb-hdd-storage
    ```

5.  Mount the USB HDD to this folder, this assumes your USB HDD is formatted as NTFS. Firstly check to see the partitions available on the USB HDD drive:

    ``` language-bash
    sudo blkid
    ```

    This should output the USB HDD's label, keep a note of this.

6.  Check the boot name of the USB HDD's partition:

    ``` language-bash
    sudo fdisk -l
    ```

7.  Now we know where our drive is, we need to mount it to the `/usb-hdd-storage`{.language-bash} folder we created previously:

    ``` language-bash
    sudo mount /dev/sdaX /usb-hdd-storage
    ```

    You may need to replace `X`{.language-bash} with your drive ID. This can be found from the 'blkid' command.

    You'll also have to set permissions to ensure the drive can be accessed properly:

    ``` language-bash
    sudo chmod 775 /usb-hdd-storage
    ```

8.  To make the USB HDD mount permanently, edit the 'fstab' file:

    ``` language-bash
    sudo nano /etc/fstab
    ```

    Add this line to the bottom of the file:

    ``` language-bash
    /dev/sdaX /usb-hdd-storage ntfs defaults 0 0
    ```

    As before, replace `X`{.language-bash} with your drive ID.

    Note: If you need to unmount the drive, run:

    ``` language-bash
    sudo umount /usb-hdd-storage
    ```

9.  Create a folder in the 'ftp-user' home directory, this will be used in the next step to 'bind' to the folder we created in `/root/usb-hdd-storage`{.language-bash}:

    ``` language-bash
    sudo mkdir /home/ftp-user/usb-hdd-storage
    ```

10. Perform a bind to where the USB HDD is mounted. Edit the 'fstab' file so this bind is permanent:

    ``` language-bash
    sudo nano /etc/fstab
    ```

    Add this line to the bottom of the file, it should be below the line which was added in the previous step:

    ``` language-bash
    /usb-hdd-storage /home/ftp-user/usb-hdd-storage none bind 0 0
    ```

11. Now change the ownership of this folder to the 'ftp-user' user:

    ``` language-bash
    sudo chown ftp-user:ftp-user /home/ftp-user/usb-hdd-storage
    ```

12. Install proFTPd:

    ``` language-bash
    sudo apt install proftpd
    ```

    Choose to run proFTPd as `standalone`{.language-bash}.

13. Now edit the proFTPd configuration file:

    ``` language-bash
    sudo nano /etc/proftpd/proftpd.conf
    ```

    Change the `TimeoutIdle`{.language-bash} value to `60`{.language-bash}. This is 60 seconds.

    And uncomment `DefaultRoot`{.language-bash} so users are 'jailed' to their home directories, they will still be able to access files on the USB HDD because of the 'binded' folder we created.

14. Reload the proFTPd service to pick-up the changes made in the configuration file:

    ``` language-bash
    sudo service proftpd reload
    ```

15. You can now reboot the operating system and test the connection in a FTP program, such as FileZilla.

    ``` language-bash
    sudo shutdown -r now
    ```

    Or to shutdown, run:

    ``` language-bash
    sudo shutdown -h now
    ```
