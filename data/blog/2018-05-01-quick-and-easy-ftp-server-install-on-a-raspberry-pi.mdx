<p>For this setup, i&#8217;m using Ubuntu 16.04 running on a Raspberry Pi 3. The instructions should work correctly in Debian and Raspbian too &#8211; in fact, you will probably have luck using these instructions on any Linux operating system, Raspberry Pi or not.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> FTP is not a secure protocol, I would recommend using SFTP for production environments.</p>
<ol>
<li>
        Login to SSH with `root` or a user which has sudo permissions. The default Raspberry Pi `pi` user should be okay.
    </li>
<li>
        Update packages:</p>
```
sudo apt-get update
```
</li>
<li>
        Create a new user, used only for FTP connections: </p>
```
sudo adduser ftp-user
```
<p>Enter a password of your choice.
    </li>
<li>
        Create a folder in `/root`. This is where the USB HDD will be permanently mounted.</p>
```
sudo mkdir /usb-hdd-storage
```
</li>
<li>
        Mount the USB HDD to this folder, this assumes your USB HDD is formatted as NTFS. Firstly check to see the partitions available on the USB HDD drive:</p>
```
sudo blkid
```
<p>This should output the USB HDD&#8217;s label, keep a note of this.
    </li>
<li>
        Check the boot name of the USB HDD&#8217;s partition:</p>
```
sudo fdisk -l
```
</li>
<li>
        Now we know where our drive is, we need to mount it to the `/usb-hdd-storage` folder we created previously:</p>
```
sudo mount /dev/sdaX /usb-hdd-storage
```
<p>You may need to replace `X` with your drive ID. This can be found from the &#8216;blkid&#8217; command.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll also have to set permissions to ensure the drive can be accessed properly:</p>
```
sudo chmod 775 /usb-hdd-storage
```
</li>
<li>
        To make the USB HDD mount permanently, edit the &#8216;fstab&#8217; file:</p>
```
sudo nano /etc/fstab
```
<p>Add this line to the bottom of the file:</p>
```
/dev/sdaX /usb-hdd-storage ntfs defaults 0 0
```
<p>As before, replace `X` with your drive ID.</p>
<p>Note: If you need to unmount the drive, run:</p>
```
sudo umount /usb-hdd-storage
```
</li>
<li>
        Create a folder in the &#8216;ftp-user&#8217; home directory, this will be used in the next step to &#8216;bind&#8217; to the folder we created in `/root/usb-hdd-storage`:</p>
```
sudo mkdir /home/ftp-user/usb-hdd-storage
```
</li>
<li>
        Perform a bind to where the USB HDD is mounted. Edit the &#8216;fstab&#8217; file so this bind is permanent:</p>
```
sudo nano /etc/fstab
```
<p>Add this line to the bottom of the file, it should be below the line which was added in the previous step:</p>
```
/usb-hdd-storage /home/ftp-user/usb-hdd-storage none bind 0 0
```
</li>
<li>
        Now change the ownership of this folder to the &#8216;ftp-user&#8217; user:</p>
```
sudo chown ftp-user:ftp-user /home/ftp-user/usb-hdd-storage
```
</li>
<li>
        Install proFTPd:</p>
```
sudo apt install proftpd
```
<p>Choose to run proFTPd as `standalone`.
    </li>
<li>
        Now edit the proFTPd configuration file:</p>
```
sudo nano /etc/proftpd/proftpd.conf
```
<p>Change the `TimeoutIdle` value to `60`. This is 60 seconds.</p>
<p>And uncomment `DefaultRoot` so users are &#8216;jailed&#8217; to their home directories, they will still be able to access files on the USB HDD because of the &#8216;binded&#8217; folder we created.
    </li>
<li>
        Reload the proFTPd service to pick-up the changes made in the configuration file:</p>
```
sudo service proftpd reload
```
</li>
<li>
        You can now reboot the operating system and test the connection in a FTP program, such as FileZilla.</p>
```
sudo shutdown -r now
```
<p>Or to shutdown, run:</p>
```
sudo shutdown -h now
```
</li>
</ol>
