  Email newsletters are great, sure you can go to websites such as{' '}
  <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/">Sitepoint</a> or{' '}
  <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/">Smashing Magazine</a> and view articles themselves. But
  I find receiving newsletters makes sure I read the most relevant and important articles at the end
  of a week.
</p>
<p>
  I mostly sign up for newsletters to keep myself up-to-date with the latest web design news, and
  tend to get these emailed on Friday; this gives me some reading material for the weekend.
</p>
<p>These are some of the newsletters I highly recommend:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/newsletter/">Sitepoint</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/the-smashing-newsletter/">Smashing Magazine</a>
  </li>
  <li>
