Email newsletters are great, sure you can go to websites such as [Sitepoint](http://www.sitepoint.com/) or [Smashing Magazine](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/) and view articles themselves. But I find receiving newsletters makes sure I read the most relevant and important articles at the end of a week.

I mostly sign up for newsletters to keep myself up-to-date with the latest web design news, and tend to get these emailed on Friday; this gives me some reading material for the weekend.

These are some of the newsletters I highly recommend:

-   [Sitepoint](http://www.sitepoint.com/newsletter/)
-   [Smashing Magazine](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/the-smashing-newsletter/)
-   [Web Development Reading List](https://wdrl.info/)
-   [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/subscription-options/)

If you have your own favourites, please mention them in the comments.
