For quite some time I have found the need to have a small dedicated computer to act as a file and print server for the multiple computers I have running at home.

I did research of the best possible hardware for the tasks which I needed the server to perform. Since the server will be running 24/7 I needed it be reliable, quite, small on power and not to produce too much heat.

After careful consideration I purchased these components which I though would be best suited for my setup:

-   [Antec ISK 300-150 Mini-ITX Case](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0036CSMSG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=B0036CSMSG&linkCode=as2&tag=ryanfittoncou-21)
-   [Intel D410PT Desktop Motherboard with Intel Atom (D410 1.66GHz)](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00336YCCU/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=B00336YCCU&linkCode=as2&tag=ryanfittoncou-21)
-   [120GB WD 2.5 SATA Scorpio Blue HDD](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B000Y8QNMW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=B000Y8QNMW&linkCode=as2&tag=ryanfittoncou-21)
-   [Corsair Memory XMS2 2GB DDR2 PC2-6400 (800) Dual Channel](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00160P77Y/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=B00160P77Y&linkCode=as2&tag=ryanfittoncou-21)

Once I managed to get everything built I decided to install [Ubuntu Server 12.04 LTS](http://releases.ubuntu.com/12.04/) since it was free and ran with a small footprint which would allow me to get more performance from the Atom processor and the limited amount of RAM. I didn't bother installing the GUI (Graphical User Interface) since I would be running the server as a headless device, although if I did need to get access to the terminal I would SSH into it from another computer using a free program called [PuTTY](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/).

I then installed the required software. Samba and Cups were installed to handle file and print serving. I also decided to install [Mediatomb](http://mediatomb.cc/) for media streaming to my UPnP devices, [vsftpd](https://security.appspot.com/vsftpd.html) (Very Secure FTP) was installed for FTP file transfer and Apache was also installed so I could host an internal website it required.

Everything went extremely smoothly to get the server up and running. I now have a network server which I can use to easily share files and printers around the house. The 120GB Hard Drive may need upgrading in the future, although I find the Atom processor and 2GB RAM handle all my requirements without any issues.

If anyone is thinking of setting up a server for then home, then I would highly encourage you to take the step and get involved.
