  Instead of using the TP-Link TL-R470T+ router at home which I&#8217;ve showed in a previous post [
  <a href="https://ryanfitton.co.uk/blog/how-i-installed-cat6-ethernet-in-my-home/">link</a>], I
  have decided it&#8217;s time to take the plunge and start using proper router software, pfSense.
</p>
<p>
  pfSense is open-source router/firewall software. It comes with many advanced features and is often
  used in the enterprise, it&#8217;s probably overkill in the home but I enjoy having enterprise
  ready features at my fingertips!
</p>
<p>
  I was looking to host pfSense in a virtual machine but I felt un-easy running this on the same
  machine as I use for the rest of my network (Printer serving, IP camera recording, etc.). Also if
  the host went down, the Internet would too. A dedicated solution with low energy usage but with
  enough &#8216;oomph&#8217;, support for AES-NI and at least two network interfaces.

<p>
  My first thought was to check the device offerings from{' '}

  <a href="https://www.pfsense.org/">pfSense</a>), however I felt these were too expensive for my
  use case. Then I came across the{' '}

  The total came to around Â£120.00 including UPS shipping (tracked and insured), delivery took a
  couple of weeks but the device came intact ready for setup.
</p>
<p>
  I added some labels above the ports and a label for the device&#8217;s IP address to make this
  easier to troubleshoot if required in the future.

  The varient I ordered was the &#8216;barebones&#8217; unit and I supplied my own RAM and mSATA SSD
  from Amazon:

  <li>
    2GB RAM, link:{' '}

<p>
  The components were extremely easy to fit, just remove the screws from the aluminium case and
  connect the components to the motherboard. You have the option of mounting a 2.5 inch Sata hard
  drive, there is mounting holes on the underside of the lid, however I went for a 16GB mSATA SSD as
  pfSense was only going to be installed.

  After this was done, it was time to burn the pfSense ISO to a USB stick. I used Etcher running on
  Ubuntu 18.04 to do this.
</p>
<p>
  The machine booted from the USB device and ran through the install &#8211; although I won&#8217;t
  get into how to install pfSense in this article, but it is very easy. The official website has
  some great installation instructions:{' '}

  </a>
</p>
<p>
  Once the machine was setup, I set my WAN and LAN network connections. I then tested my 100MB
  Virgin Media connection and was happy to find the router maxed out my download speed with ease
  running over it&#8217;s two gigabit ports, and with the AES-NI support means it is
  &#8216;future-proofed&#8217; for version 2.5 of pfSense.
</p>
<p>
  I have currently been running this 24/7 for a couple of months, the temperature reported by
  pfSense is always at 26.9 degrees and I have not had any lock-ups or other issues over this
  period. If you&#8217;re looking for a small mini-pc, the Qotom is definetlydefinitely a good
  choice.
