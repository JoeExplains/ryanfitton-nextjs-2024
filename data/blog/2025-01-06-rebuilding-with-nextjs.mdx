## Why?

I've always wanted to become more involved with JS frameworks. I have had exposure to Vue JS in the past but haven't ever used it in depth and didn't fully understand how it worked.

Since August 2024, I have been rebuilding my WordPress-powered website into one running on Next.js with the theme handled by Tailwind. I've wanted to do this for a long time. My old WordPress theme was built in 2014 (a long time ago in the web development world), and a lot has changed over this time. I had a few reasons for wanting to rebuild the site, mainly:

1. WordPress is slow and cumbersome. My journey with WordPress started in 2011, long before the introduction of the Gutenberg editor and the inclusion of more JS bloat within the dashboard.
2. While the WordPress theme was custom-built with Sass, I haven't been maintaining the theme over time. Neither have I been updating the WordPress core during this period (it's been at least three years since applying the last update), and I'm afraid something might break.
3. WordPress requires multiple services to be hosted (PHP, Apache/Nginx, Database). While I can maintain these services, it's not something I want to do every month. I have always been intrigued by sites running a flat file system, hosted on services such as GitHub Pages, which will save me money on hosting fees. Being hosted on a platform that can handle large volumes of traffic, and being static files without relying on plugins or a database, is inherently more secure.
4. There has been a recent [on-going saga between Automattic and WP Engine](https://css-tricks.com/catching-up-on-the-wordpress-wp-engine-sitch/) that is pushing me away from the 'happy' community atmosphere that used to be prevalent in the WordPress community. I understand Matt's reasoning behind his recent speech at [WordCamp US 2024](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress/comments/1flqqm5/matt_just_threw_wp_engine_under_the_bus_hard/), but I don't feel this was the correct approach for multiple reasons. This is not something I would like to be part of.
5. Finally, the main motivation is that this will give me the opportunity to learn a JS framework platform, leading to further career opportunities.

## The Rebuild

Before starting the rebuild, I already downloaded and set up a local copy of Next.js and had a 'play' around with it. I understand the inner workings much better now but still lacked the ability to create a Next.js powered website from scratch.

Enter [Timothy](https://github.com/timlrx)'s Next.js and Tailwind starter blog (https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog). I noticed the Readme listed forks/examples made by others, which encouraged me to do the same.

### Custom Changes

This is a fantastic starter template but still required me to make some changes to make the template work for my use case. These were:

1. A separate 'portfolio' post section was required. By default, the template used the 'blog' section but with a different layout template. However, this meant portfolio posts still had their URL scheme as 'https://example.com/blog/portfolio-item'.
2. Update the Tailwind template, including color schemes, fonts, margin/padding/font sizes, along with edits to the HTML templates.
3. Including the use of a Cloudflare image loader so their Image Transformations API can be used. As I'm using Cloudflare as my DNS provider already, I can enable this API to convert image formats, sizes, and quality directly via the URL. For example:
   - Original URL: '/static/img/blog/2023/03/IMG_20230311_113236-768x1024.jpg'
   - Image Transform API, setting the image to WebP, 200px width with 75% quality: /blog/cdn-cgi/image/width=200,quality=75,format=webp/static/img/blog/2023/03/IMG_20230311_113236-768x1024.jpg
4. Set up a GitHub Actions workflow to host the website and automatically upload any changes pushed to the 'main' branch.
5. Setting up new 'social media' icons, as the starter template didn't include all the social icons I required, such as KeyBase, Bluesky, and others.
6. Due to adding a separate 'portfolio' section, I also had to update the [Sitemap](/sitemap.xml) and [RSS feed](/feed.xml) generation script to include posts from this new section.

### Timeline

I have been working on development changes since August 2024 and finally finished major development work in January 2025.

There are still some small bugs I need to fix, such as:

1. Clean up the repo's [Readme file](https://github.com/ryanfitton/ryanfitton-nextjs-2024/blob/main/README.md).
2. ~~Disqus comment styles not appearing correctly in Dark Mode.~~
3. ~~Add the publish date to portfolio posts.~~
4. ~~Fix image sizing on the Portfolio index.~~ 
5. ~~ Add image support to the Blogs index.~~ 
6. Some PageSpeed optimization required, mainly the video header on the homepage.

However, these are relatively straightforward. Probably the most tedious part of this process was migrating the WordPress posts into Markdown format. The only good way to do this was a manual copy-paste and fixing up the post content with a find and replace.

Images were straightforward to copy over; I essentially copied all non-empty folders from 'wp-content'.

## Final Conclusion

I am really happy with the progress I have made getting to grips with Next.js and the custom changes made to the template.

Going forward, I will be contributing some of the changes I have made back to [Timothy](https://github.com/timlrx)'s project and will regularly implement any new bug fixes published by the project.
