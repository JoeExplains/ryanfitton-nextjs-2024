<p>This simple PHP script can be used to perform HTTP and HTTPS redirects for your domains. I created this script as my DNS provider does not provide a URL redirection service of their own, and I didn&#8217;t want to setup webspace or a virtualhost on my server just for a redirect.</p>
<p>To use this script, you should already have a free IPv4 address and domain. Setup these as a host on a server or VPS &#8211; I recommend <a href="https://m.do.co/c/fbe5f1c0c98d" target="_blank">Digital Ocean (referral link)</a>.</p>
<h4>Redirection DNS Settings</h4>
<p>Within your DNS settings point your domain or subdomain to the server you have setup.</p>
<p>For subdomains, this is done by setting up a CNAME record. For apex/naked domains, it is recommended that you use an ALIAS or ANAME record type if your DNS provider supports it. Otherwise, use an A record:</p>
<ul>
<li>CNAME and ALIAS/ANAME records should point to <code class="language-markup">yourdomain.com</code></li>
<li>A records should point to <code class="language-markup">123.45.67.89</code></li>
</ul>
<p>To configure the redirection destination, add a TXT record for your domain:</p>
<ul>
<li>TXT value: <code class="language-markup">"redirect_https://www.google.com"</code></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Remember to replace these values with your own.</p>
<h4>Example DNS zone file</h4>
<p>This is an example zone file for www. and non-www. addresses:</p>
<p><strong>CNAME:</strong></p>
<pre class="language-markup"><code class="language-markup">example.com. 1800 IN CNAME 123.45.67.89
www.example.com. 1800 IN CNAME 123.45.67.89</code></pre>
<p><strong>A Records:</strong></p>
<pre class="language-markup"><code class="language-markup">www.example.com. 1800 IN A 123.45.67.89
www.example.com. 1800 IN A 123.45.67.89</code></pre>
<p><strong>TXT Values:</strong></p>
<pre class="language-markup"><code class="language-markup">example.com. 1800 IN TXT "redirect_https://www.google.com"
www.example.com. 1800 IN TXT "redirect_https://www.google.com"</code></pre>
