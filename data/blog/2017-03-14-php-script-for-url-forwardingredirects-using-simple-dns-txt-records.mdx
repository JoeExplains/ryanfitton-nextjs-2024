This simple PHP script can be used to perform HTTP and HTTPS redirects for your domains. I created this script as my DNS provider does not provide a URL redirection service of their own, and I didn't want to setup webspace or a virtualhost on my server just for a redirect.

To use this script, you should already have a free IPv4 address and domain. Setup these as a host on a server or VPS -- I recommend [Digital Ocean (referral link)](https://m.do.co/c/fbe5f1c0c98d).

#### Redirection DNS Settings

Within your DNS settings point your domain or subdomain to the server you have setup.

For subdomains, this is done by setting up a CNAME record. For apex/naked domains, it is recommended that you use an ALIAS or ANAME record type if your DNS provider supports it. Otherwise, use an A record:

-   CNAME and ALIAS/ANAME records should point to `yourdomain.com`
-   A records should point to `123.45.67.89`

To configure the redirection destination, add a TXT record for your domain:

-   TXT value: `"redirect_https://www.google.com"`

**Note:** Remember to replace these values with your own.

#### Example DNS zone file

This is an example zone file for www. and non-www. addresses:

**CNAME:**

``` language-markup
example.com. 1800 IN CNAME 123.45.67.89
www.example.com. 1800 IN CNAME 123.45.67.89
```

**A Records:**

``` language-markup
www.example.com. 1800 IN A 123.45.67.89
www.example.com. 1800 IN A 123.45.67.89
```

**TXT Values:**

``` language-markup
example.com. 1800 IN TXT "redirect_https://www.google.com"
www.example.com. 1800 IN TXT "redirect_https://www.google.com"
```

#### PHP Script

``` language-php
<?php
/**
 * Redirect URL based on DNS TXT record value. Requires A records to be pointed to the server's IP Address and a TXT record with redirection value.

//The redirect prefix
$prefix = 'redirect_';

//Find the TXT DNS records for this host
$txts = dns_get_record($_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'], DNS_TXT);

//Loop through each TXT record
foreach($txts as $txt) {
    //Loop through each record entry
    foreach($txt['entries'] as $txtValue) {
        
        //If the text record includes 'redirect_'
        if (strpos($txtValue, $prefix) !== false) {
            
            //Explode the TXT value
            $explode_txtValue = explode($prefix, $txtValue);
            
            //Set the 1st key as the URL addrress and Sanitize data
            $url = filter_var($explode_txtValue[1], FILTER_SANITIZE_URL);
            
            //Check if URL is valid
            if (filter_var($url, FILTER_VALIDATE_URL)) {
                //Perform a temporary redirect (302)
                header('Location: ' . $url, true, 302);
                exit;
                
            //If the URL is not valid
            } else {
                //Display message on screen
                echo 'Invalid URL: ' . $url;
                exit;
            }
        }
    }
}
?>
```
