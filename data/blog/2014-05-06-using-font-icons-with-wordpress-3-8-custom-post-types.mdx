  WordPress 3.8 introduced a new Admin design which now uses Font Icons instead of images. This
  method has many benefits such as great support for Retina devices and quicker load times.
</p>
<p>
  Before WordPress 3.8 you had to use images for your icons, now you can use Font Icons,
  specifically the icons designed for WordPress called &#8220;
  <a href="http://melchoyce.github.io/dashicons/">Dashicons</a>&#8220;.
</p>
<p>
  A full list of Dashicons can be found here:{' '}

</p>
<p>
  To get Font Icons working for your Custom Post Type, simple set the &#8220;menu_icon&#8221;
  argument along with the icon class name when you are registering your post type. An example of
  this code is below:
