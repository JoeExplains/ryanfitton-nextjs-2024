<p>I&#8217;ve been looking at how to change the button icon which is shown across Bootstrap 3 navigation menus in a mobile viewport.</p>
<p>For months I&#8217;ve come across a <a href="http://codepen.io/search?q=navicon&amp;limit=all&amp;depth=everything&amp;show_forks=false">whole variety</a> of clever Navicon icons which change when clicked upon.</p>
<p>I wanted to implement this feature into a Bootstrap navigation menu. In the end, I used a couple small lines of code which use jQuery.</p>
<p>The code toggles between two CSS classes. The toggle is activated when the menu button is pressed.</p>
<p>As I am using <a href="http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/">FontAwesome</a> icons, this uses class names. Therefore toggling between two CSS classes will change the FontAwesome icons which are used in the menu.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve embedded two Github Gists below which show the Javascript code and the markup of my Bootstrap menu.</p>
