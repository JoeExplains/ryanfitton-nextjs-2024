I've been using a few Raspberry Pi Zeros for a while, and whilst they're
great, small, cheap boards they have always lacked a dedicated Ethernet
port.

I could always attach a USB to Ethernet dongle, which I have done in the
past but then it adds more bulk and cost -- so I may as well just buy a
standard Pi.

Fast forward to this week: [I've
seen](https://www.circuitbasics.com/raspberry-pi-zero-ethernet-gadget/)
the RPI Zero has an 'OTG' mode, where the data micro-usb port can
receive data and power via a single port. With this in mind, I dug out
my old Google Chrome Cast Ethernet power adaptor, and attached the
micro-usb cable into the data port of the Pi Zero. The Pi Zero booted-up
without any issues and was able to receive a network connection!

Whilst this isn't technically a PoE solution, it's just as good for me.
I'm able to use just one cable and minimise the amount of adaptors. Best
of all this solution costs a total of Â£20 (this includes the Pi!).

**Disclaimer:** I'm using the original [Pi
Zero](https://thepihut.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero) (v1.3, no-wifi)
with the latest [Raspbian](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/) image
(released on 2020/02/13) with a [Google Chrome Cast
Ethernet](https://store.google.com/gb/product/ethernet_adapter_for_chromecast)
adaptor (model: EA4CC-1U)

I've also seen other people have discovered this trick too:
[Here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=131379),
[here](http://www.makerspace-uk.co.uk/raspberry-pi-zero-networking-solutions/)
and
[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/3zha14/pizero_works_out_of_the_box_with_a_chromecast/).
This technique also seems to be very similar with how the [Tesla USB
project](https://github.com/marcone/teslausb) is using the data
micro-usb port.
