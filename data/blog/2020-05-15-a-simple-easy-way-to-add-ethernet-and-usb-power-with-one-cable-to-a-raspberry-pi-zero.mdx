  I&#8217;ve been using a few Raspberry Pi Zeros for a while, and whilst they&#8217;re great, small,
  cheap boards they have always lacked a dedicated Ethernet port.
</p>
<p>
  I could always attach a USB to Ethernet dongle, which I have done in the past but then it adds
  more bulk and cost &#8211; so I may as well just buy a standard Pi.
</p>
<p>
  Fast forward to this week:{' '}
  <a href="https://www.circuitbasics.com/raspberry-pi-zero-ethernet-gadget/">I&#8217;ve seen</a> the
  RPI Zero has an &#8216;OTG&#8217; mode, where the data micro-usb port can receive data and power
  via a single port. With this in mind, I dug out my old Google Chrome Cast Ethernet power adaptor,
  and attached the micro-usb cable into the data port of the Pi Zero. The Pi Zero booted-up without
  any issues and was able to receive a network connection!
</p>
<p>
  Whilst this isn&#8217;t technically a PoE solution, it&#8217;s just as good for me. I&#8217;m able
  to use just one cable and minimise the amount of adaptors. Best of all this solution costs a total
  of Â£20 (this includes the Pi!).

  <strong>Disclaimer:</strong> I&#8217;m using the original{' '}
  <a href="https://thepihut.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero">Pi Zero</a> (v1.3, no-wifi) with the
  latest <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/">Raspbian</a> image (released on
  2020/02/13) with a{' '}
  <a href="https://store.google.com/gb/product/ethernet_adapter_for_chromecast">
    Google Chrome Cast Ethernet
  </a>{' '}
  adaptor (model: EA4CC-1U)
</p>
<p>
  I&#8217;ve also seen other people have discovered this trick too:{' '}
  <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=131379">Here</a>,{' '}
  <a href="http://www.makerspace-uk.co.uk/raspberry-pi-zero-networking-solutions/">here</a> and{' '}
  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/3zha14/pizero_works_out_of_the_box_with_a_chromecast/">
    here
  </a>
  . This technique also seems to be very similar with how the{' '}
  <a href="https://github.com/marcone/teslausb">Tesla USB project</a> is using the data micro-usb
  port.
