Git is fantastic for version control, I have been using it quite often this month for work and personal projects.

Although this isn't the first time I have used Git, I did use it whilst at university. Although at that time I only used the Github Windows GUI client and whilst it was okay it did turn out to be slow.

Since I have begun using Git at work, I have started to only use the Git CLI client. Using the Command Line makes using Git so much quicker, since I needed some further reading regarding Git I came across the [Git Pocket Guide](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1449325866/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=1449325866&linkCode=as2&tag=ryanfittoncou-21) . This book is pretty much a cut down version of [Version Control with Git](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1449316387/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=1449316387&linkCode=as2&tag=ryanfittoncou-21) . The pocket book is great and has the answers to any questions you may have.
