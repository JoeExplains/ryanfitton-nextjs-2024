The [Neos Smart
cam](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Neos-SmartCam-Vision-Camera-Warranty/dp/B07JY7K3SZ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=ryanfittoncou-21&linkId=50da75e73cc1e4cc66bbdffdeae74299&language=en_GB)
is a small indoor security camera based on the [Xiaomi
Xiaofang](https://uk.gearbest.com/ip-cameras/pp_487830.html) hardware,
this is similar to the [Wyze Cam
2](https://www.wyze.com/product/wyze-cam-v2/) which is also based on the
same Xiaomi hardware.

I've wanted one of these for a while, and now the [Neos smart
cam](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07JY7K3SZ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&psc=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=ryanfittoncou-21&linkId=c94405cba7c64a2c881f432a0522ec92&language=en_GB)
is readily available on Amazon in the UK, I thought now would be a good
opportunity to try one out. Currently they're retailing for £24.99 and
can be delivered through Amazon Prime.

By default, Neos offer 14 days of cloud storage for free (no monthly
subscription) which is pretty great considering the price. But I already
have a CCTV solution at home running open-source [Shinobi DVR
software](https://gitlab.com/Shinobi-Systems/Shinobi) and needed
something that could provide an RTSP stream.

This is where the Xiaomi DaFang Hacks software comes in. Available on
GitHub
[here](https://github.com/EliasKotlyar/Xiaomi-Dafang-Hacks/blob/master/README.md),
the code for the Neos camera only available through this commit for the
moment; until it is merged into the master branch:
<https://github.com/EliasKotlyar/Xiaomi-Dafang-Hacks/pull/964>.

DaFang hacks is custom firmware which you can flash to the camera via a
MicroSD card. This give you benefits such as; no relying on the
manufacturer's cloud services, SSH and FTP services on the camera
itself, and the best: RTSP stream support -- this will allow you to
integrate the camera into any DVR recording software, such as Shinobi,
ZoneMinder or Synology's Surveillance Station.

## How to install

1.  Firstly, download the custom firmware .bin file, this is the same
    firmware for the Wyzecam:
    <https://github.com/EliasKotlyar/Xiaomi-Dafang-Hacks/raw/master/hacks/cfw/wyzecam_v2/cfw-1.1.bin>
    or via the repo page here:
    <https://github.com/EliasKotlyar/Xiaomi-Dafang-Hacks/>
2.  Now have your MicroSD card ready. I used this [Toshiba 16GB
    card](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B078TPK9JF/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&psc=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=ryanfittoncou-21&linkId=fe859fa72a792fc1ba680f01786e098b&language=en_GB),
    and setup a single 512mb partition using gParted. This is how I
    formatted the card using gParted:
    1.  Insert the MicroSD card into your computer and load up gParted.
        Select your card/drive from the dropdown at the top right, and
        delete all partitions so it is only showing 'unallocated':\
        [![](/static/img/blog/2019/06/dafang-1.png){loading="lazy"
        width="775" height="537"
        srcset="/static/img/blog/2019/06/dafang-1.png 775w, /static/img/blog/2019/06/dafang-1-300x208.png 300w, /static/img/blog/2019/06/dafang-1-768x532.png 768w"
        sizes="(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px"}](/static/img/blog/2019/06/dafang-1.png)
    2.  Now create a FAT32 512mb partition:\
        [![](/static/img/blog/2019/06/dafang2.png){loading="lazy"
        width="774" height="534"
        srcset="/static/img/blog/2019/06/dafang2.png 774w, /static/img/blog/2019/06/dafang2-300x207.png 300w, /static/img/blog/2019/06/dafang2-768x530.png 768w"
        sizes="(max-width: 774px) 100vw, 774px"}](/static/img/blog/2019/06/dafang2.png)
    3.  Click add, then you should see the new partition ready to be
        created:\
        [![](/static/img/blog/2019/06/dafang-3.png){loading="lazy"
        width="775" height="537"
        srcset="/static/img/blog/2019/06/dafang-3.png 775w, /static/img/blog/2019/06/dafang-3-300x208.png 300w, /static/img/blog/2019/06/dafang-3-768x532.png 768w"
        sizes="(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px"}](/static/img/blog/2019/06/dafang-3.png)
    4.  Click the 'tick' icon to apply the operations. You should see a
        success message:\
        [![](/static/img/blog/2019/06/dafang-4.png){loading="lazy"
        width="775" height="537"
        srcset="/static/img/blog/2019/06/dafang-4.png 775w, /static/img/blog/2019/06/dafang-4-300x208.png 300w, /static/img/blog/2019/06/dafang-4-768x532.png 768w"
        sizes="(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px"}](/static/img/blog/2019/06/dafang-4.png)
3.  Once your partition has been created, copy the 'cfw-1.1.bin' file to
    the drive. You must then rename this file to: 'demo.bin'. It is
    important that you ensure this is the only file on your MicroSD
    card.
4.  Now insert the MicroSD card into the base of your Neos Smartcam,
    ensure no USB cable is connected.
5.  Connect the USB cable and ensure you're holding down the setup
    button. Whilst holding the setup button, the LED indicator on the
    Smart cam should light-up blue, once you see this carry on holding
    the setup button down for 20 seconds, then let go. The instructions
    on [Dafang's Github
    page](https://github.com/EliasKotlyar/Xiaomi-Dafang-Hacks/blob/master/hacks/install_cfw.md)
    state this may take up to 3 minutes, but for me this was much less.
    I knew this process was finished when the LED started to flash
    yellow rapidly. Looking up this response, means 'Ready to setup',
    [source](https://github.com/EliasKotlyar/Xiaomi-Dafang-Hacks/issues/651).
    This process alters the bootloader on the Smart cam so it can boot
    custom firmware. If you're having issues, check this video -- it
    helped me a lot with this process:\

    :::::: iframe
    ::: {#player}

    :::: player-unavailable

6.  Now re-insert your MicroSD card into your computer and empty all
    files on this MicroSD card. Then download the 'Xiaomi-Dafang-Hacks'
    repository, here:
    <https://github.com/EliasKotlyar/Xiaomi-Dafang-Hacks>. Click the
    green button named 'Clone or download', then select 'Download ZIP'.\
    [![](/static/img/blog/2019/06/dafang-5.png){loading="lazy"
    width="1015" height="478"
    srcset="/static/img/blog/2019/06/dafang-5.png 1015w, /static/img/blog/2019/06/dafang-5-300x141.png 300w, /static/img/blog/2019/06/dafang-5-768x362.png 768w"
    sizes="(max-width: 1015px) 100vw, 1015px"}](https://github.com/EliasKotlyar/Xiaomi-Dafang-Hacks)
7.  Once the .zip file has downloaded, extract this and copy the entire
    contents of 'firmware_mod' to your MicroSD card.
8.  You will want to add your Wireless Network settings. On the MicroSD
    card, find the folder named 'config'. Enter this directory and find
    the file named 'wpa_supplicant.conf.dist', rename this file to
    'wpa_supplicant.conf'.
9.  Now edit the 'wpa_supplicant.conf' file in a code editor. Change the
    values for 'ssid' and 'psk' with your own wireless network name and
    password, e.g:\
    [![](/static/img/blog/2019/06/dafang-6.png){loading="lazy"
    width="431" height="202"
    srcset="/static/img/blog/2019/06/dafang-6.png 431w, /static/img/blog/2019/06/dafang-6-300x141.png 300w"
    sizes="(max-width: 431px) 100vw, 431px"}](https://github.com/EliasKotlyar/Xiaomi-Dafang-Hacks/blob/master/firmware_mod/config/wpa_supplicant.conf.dist)
10. Now save the file, and insert the MicroSD card back into your Neos
    Smartcam and power-on.
11. If all goes well, you should be able to access the web interface in
    a web browser at: <https://dafang> with the default login details;
    username: root and password: ismart12
12. The default RTSP stream URL is: <rtsp://ip-address:8554/unicast>
    (replace the IP address with the one associated with your smart
    cam).

 

## Updates
[Update: 11/08/2019\]: I use Shinobi to record the RTSP stream, but
have been having some issues with the stream recordings only being
around 30 to 45 seconds long, they should have been 5 minutes.

I have managed to fix this by altering the settings within the Dafang
web interface to:

-   Disable audio recording
-   Disable motion detection
-   After disabling these two options, I saw the CPU usage drop from 80%
    to around 20%.

I also set these options for the video feed:

-   Video size: 1600×900
-   Bitrate: 500kbps
-   Video format: VBR
-   Frame rate: 24 every 1 second\

Finally, I setup the SWAP with a swapfile size of 512MB within the
'run.sh' file.

[Update: 14/06/2020\]: I am no longer using this camera due to constant
instability issues with Dafang dropping the RTSP with Shinobi. Where
this may be fixed in the future, I am now using a Foscam C1 ([Newer
Model](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07WHY74F1/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=ryanfittoncou-21&camp=1634&creative=6738&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B07WHY74F1&linkId=cab92c8366ebb3ef4cc1ffd0a54abe04))
