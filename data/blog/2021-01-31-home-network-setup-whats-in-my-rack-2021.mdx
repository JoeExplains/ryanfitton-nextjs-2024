Following on from my [original post](https://ryanfitton.co.uk/blog/how-i-installed-cat6-ethernet-in-my-home/) in 2017 and a [follow up](https://ryanfitton.co.uk/blog/home-network-setup-whats-in-my-rack-2019/) I made in 2019, I am making this post to show the changes my to my home network.

Some parts have not changed. such as;

-   The rack, a 9U with dimensions of 600x600mm.
-   I am still running pfSense on a [Qotom Q150P-S08](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32863982193.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.27424c4dp3dCSF) Mini PC.
-   Still using a HP ProCurve 24 Port Gigabit Switch ([1800-24G J9028B](https://h10057.www1.hp.com/ecomcat/hpcatalog/specs/provisioner/05/J9028B.htm)) as my core network switch.
-   And [APC Back-UPS](https://www.amazon.co.uk/APC-Back-UPS-BX-Uninterruptible-Shutdown/dp/B00T7BYV6W/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=apc+700&qid=1559998754&s=computers&sr=1-4&linkCode=ll1&tag=ryanfittoncou-21&linkId=4b82a7af15071bab059cfbeeb8f3d427&language=en_GB) (BX700UI) UPS.

Although I have made changes to the LXD containers running on my home server. I am still running [Shinobi DVR](https://gitlab.com/Shinobi-Systems/Shinobi), Cups as a print server and Samba shares for network storage access. [FreePBX](https://www.freepbx.org/) has been removed and [Emby](https://emby.media/) has been replaced with [Plex](https://www.plex.tv/en-gb/). These are new containers: [Ubuntu Landscape](https://landscape.canonical.com/set-up-on-prem), [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/), [LibreNMS](https://www.librenms.org/) and [TP-Link Omada](https://ryanfitton.co.uk/blog/installing-tp-link-omada-controller-on-ubuntu/) controller software.

I have also purchased new hardware;

-   New PoE+ switch: HP 1920-24G-PoE+ (180W) JG925A -- This will be replacing a TP-Link PoE switch.
-   In the garage I have installed a new PoE+ switch: Netgear GS110TP and a TP-Link EAP 225 Outdoor access point [TP-Link EAP 225 Outdoor access point](https://www.amazon.co.uk/TP-Link-MU-MIMO-Wireless-Gigabit-Outdoor/dp/B07C217N5V?&linkCode=ll1&tag=ryanfittoncou-21&linkId=2c37be153584a9d114851b91f523b414&language=en_GB&ref_=as_li_ss_tl){target="_blank" rel="noopener"} (currently indoors, but I hope to mount this outside soon)
-   Switched broadband providers to BT. I am using an basic Openreach branded Huawei VDSL HG612 modem, the pfSense router handles PPPoE connectivity.
-   I've also purchased a [Hauwei B535-232 4G router](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07ZFSX8LB?ie=UTF8&psc=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=ryanfittoncou-21&linkId=4e46eb6fe19caf5e242adbfe0685cc59&language=en_GB&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) to act as a backup internet connection, pfSense automatically handles failover.
-   A temperature monitor using a [Raspberry Pi Zero](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Raspberry-Pi-Zero-WH/dp/B07BHMRTTY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?dchild=1&keywords=raspberry+pi+zero&qid=1609874665&s=computers&sr=1-6&linkCode=ll1&tag=ryanfittoncou-21&linkId=a7fe57b67a193551368f70f074281266&language=en_GB) with sensor [running a custom web UI](https://ryanfitton.co.uk/blog/building-a-raspberry-pi-zero-temperature-monitor-with-web-interface/) I have developed.
-   Also in the garage I have built a NAS powered by a 4GB Raspberry Pi 4, images below.

Network VLANs have been setup to help improve network security. This is one of the reasons why I purchased two new network switches. Details of these VLANs are below:

-   Lan (Default Lan network -- no VLAN, had access to all VLANs)
-   VLAN10 -- Secure network for servers (can access other VLANs, can only be accessed from LAN)
-   VLAN20 -- IP Cam network (No access to other VLANs, Internet access blocked)
-   VLAN30 -- IoT network (No access to other VLANs)
-   VLAN40 -- Guest network (No access to other VLANs, Internet access has been speed limited)
