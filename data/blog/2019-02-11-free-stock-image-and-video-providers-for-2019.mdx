This is a follow-up to the current stock image and video websites I use.

My original post is from 2016, you can view it [here](/blog/free-stock-image-websites/). Overtime the websites that offer these resources can become defunct and new providers become available -- my goal with these types of posts are to help other people and also become a go-to list.

**Note:** This list was last updated February 2019. I also sugegst you always double-check the license for any changes when using these stock resource sites.
