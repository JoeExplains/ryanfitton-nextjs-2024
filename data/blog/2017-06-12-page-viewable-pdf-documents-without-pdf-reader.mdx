<p>Here is a neat trick which I&#8217;ve found: using a tool by Google named Docs Viewer you can embed PDF (Or office and Postscript) files into a webpage to be viewed on screen, even without a PDF reader plugin installed in the user&#8217;s browser.</p>
<p>Simply use the snippet below and change where <code class="language-html">your_document_here</code> is mentioned twice with a full URL, e.g. https://example.com/doc.pdf.</p>
<pre class="language-html"><code class="language-html">&lt;object data="your_document_here" type="application/pdf" style="width:100%; height:700px"&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=your_document_here&amp;embedded=true"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/object&gt;</code></pre>
