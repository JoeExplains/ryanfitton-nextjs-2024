<p>First post of 2019! During the holidays I have been catching up on a backlog of video talks which I have been wanting to watch.</p>
<p>I have embedded the videos below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>HTTP Headers &#8211; The State of the Web</h4>
<p>This is a really good video, discussing some of the most common HTTP headers, how they&#8217;re used and why you should be using them. Andrew Betts also discusses the <a href="https://httparchive.org/">HTTP Archive</a> project.</p>

<h4>State of the Union for Speed Tooling (Chrome Dev Summit 2018)</h4>
<p>Another good video which discusses the upcoming changes in Google&#8217;s performance tools such as Lighthouse and Page Speed Insights. A good bit <a href="https://youtu.be/ymxs8OSXiUA?t=490">happens at &#8217;08:10&#8242;</a> which mentions the changes to scoring boundaries for Lighthouse &#8211; basically they&#8217;re raising the bar for how they expect how a &#8216;performance&#8217; site should be ranking.</p>

<h4>Old vs New JavaScript &#8211; HTTP203</h4>
<p>Jake and Surma discuss the changes between the methods of writing JavaScript, from the &#8216;olden&#8217; days to the new ways of working.</p>
