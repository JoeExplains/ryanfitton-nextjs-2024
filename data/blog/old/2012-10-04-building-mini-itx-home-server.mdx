  For quite some time I have found the need to have a small dedicated computer to act as a file and
  print server for the multiple computers I have running at home.
</p>
<p>
  I did research of the best possible hardware for the tasks which I needed the server to perform.
  Since the server will be running 24/7 I needed it be reliable, quite, small on power and not to
  produce too much heat.
</p>
<p>
  After careful consideration I purchased these components which I though would be best suited for
  my setup:
</p>
<ul>

  Once I managed to get everything built I decided to install{' '}
  <a href="http://releases.ubuntu.com/12.04/">Ubuntu Server 12.04 LTS</a> since it was free and ran
  with a small footprint which would allow me to get more performance from the Atom processor and
  the limited amount of RAM. I didn&#8217;t bother installing the GUI (Graphical User Interface)
  since I would be running the server as a headless device, although if I did need to get access to
  the terminal I would SSH into it from another computer using a free program called{' '}
  <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">PuTTY</a>.
</p>
<p>
  I then installed the required software. Samba and Cups were installed to handle file and print
  serving. I also decided to install <a href="http://mediatomb.cc/">Mediatomb</a> for media
  streaming to my UPnP devices, <a href="https://security.appspot.com/vsftpd.html">vsftpd</a> (Very
  Secure FTP) was installed for FTP file transfer and Apache was also installed so I could host an
  internal website it required.
</p>
<p>
  Everything went extremely smoothly to get the server up and running. I now have a network server
  which I can use to easily share files and printers around the house. The 120GB Hard Drive may need
  upgrading in the future, although I find the Atom processor and 2GB RAM handle all my requirements
  without any issues.
</p>
<p>
  If anyone is thinking of setting up a server for then home, then I would highly encourage you to
  take the step and get involved.
