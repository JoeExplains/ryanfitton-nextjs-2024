<p>Whilst you can use <a href="https://www.linux.com/news/udev-introduction-device-management-modern-linux-system">udev rules</a> with any USB device, I am writing this post to help anyone else who is also having issues with their USB printer name.</p>
<p>The main which I had was is the printer&#8217;s USB name changing when it is restarted, plugged into a different USB port or when another USB device is connected before the printer is turned on.</p>
<p>For example, connected to my computer is an APC USB based UPS, along with a Canon LBP6000 series USB printer. I originally installed the printer before I bought the UPS which meant the printer was configured to be found at &#8216;/dev/usb/lp0&#8217;.</p>
<p>However once the UPS was setup with my computer, the printer was no longer the primary device and was only accessible at &#8216;/dev/usb/lp1&#8217;. I really didn&#8217;t want to go through the painful process of re-installing the printer (the LBP6000 is notorious under Linux, I had to provide some help on <a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/778367/cannot-print-from-canon-lbp6020-ubuntu-16-04">AskUbuntu</a>), so instead I decided to create my own udev rule to assign a symlink from &#8216;lp1&#8217; to &#8216;lp0&#8217;.</p>
<p>Here is the rule I created:</p>
<pre class="language-markup"><code class="language-markup">ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="04a9", ATTRS{idProduct}=="2771", ATTRS{serial}=="0000A1E6M897", SYMLINK+="usb/lp0"</code></pre>
<p>The rule basically means: on the &#8216;add&#8217; action (when inserted) check if the device is USB and matches the &#8216;idVendor&#8217;, &#8216;idProduct&#8217; and &#8216;serial&#8217; values. If all of these are true a symlink which points to this device is created as &#8216;usb/lp0&#8217;.</p>
<p>I stored this file within <code class="language-markup">/etc/udev/rules.d/</code> as <code class="language-markup">99-printer.rules</code></p>
<p>To find out your devices attributes you can run these commands:</p>
<ul>
<li>idVendor: <code class="language-markup">udevadm info -a -n /dev/usb/lp0 | grep '{idVendor}'</code></li>
<li>idProduct: <code class="language-markup">udevadm info -a -n /dev/usb/lp0 | grep '{idProduct}'</code></li>
<li>serial: <code class="language-markup">udevadm info -a -n /dev/usb/lp0 | grep '{serial}'</code></li>
</ul>
<p>You can then change the udev rule to match your specific USB device, add the rule into a file with nano using this command:<br />
<code class="language-markup">sudo nano /etc/udev/rules.d/99-printer.rules</code></p>
<p>Then exit and save, I also reload the udev rules with this command:<br />
<code class="language-markup">sudo udevadm control --reload-rules &amp;&amp; udevadm trigger</code></p>
<p>Restart the computer, connect your USB printer, turn it on and see if your device name and symlink is shown within the USB directory:<br />
<code class="language-markup">sudo ls -l /dev/usb</code></p>
<p>I hope this post has been helpful. If you have issues, please post in the comments and I will try to help.</p>
