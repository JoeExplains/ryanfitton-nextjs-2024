  I have recently been developing a piece of work which required the scroll-bars to look flat and
  clean. I had previously seen Google&#8217;s Gmail site using the same sort of scroll-bar design
  which would fit perfectly into the piece of work I creating.
</p>
<p>
  Having a look around the web didn&#8217;t show much code snippets or tutorials; the ones which I
  did see where old and outdated. Although I did come across this{' '}
  <a href="https://gist.github.com/jambu/2004633">Gist</a> Jambu, it works perfectly.
</p>
<p>
  If you are interested in the code, I have forked it on Github{' '}
  <a href="https://gist.github.com/ryanfitton/6191707">here</a> and embedded it below.
</p>
<p>
  <script src="https://gist.github.com/ryanfitton/6191707.js"></script>
</p>
<p>
  Can&#8217;t see this Gist properly? View it on line{' '}
