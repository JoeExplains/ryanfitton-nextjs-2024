Following the outbreak of three processor vulnerabilities, known as Spectre and Meltdown; I have already patched my systems and whilst doing so, came across this useful script written by [Speed47](https://github.com/speed47/spectre-meltdown-checker).

This script checks your system for the three vulnerabilities. I found it useful to check my systems were secure after applying kernel updates.

To run the script, use these commands below:

1.  Firstly download:

    ``` language-bash
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speed47/spectre-meltdown-checker/master/spectre-meltdown-checker.sh
    ```

2.  Then run the script as sudo:

    ``` language-bash
    sudo sh spectre-meltdown-checker.sh
    ```

 

This is a quick summary of the vulnerabilities and their CVE numbers:

**[CVE-2017-5753](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-5753#)** bounds check bypass (Spectre Variant 1)

-   Impact: Kernel & all software
-   Mitigation: recompile software *and* kernel with a modified compiler that introduces the LFENCE opcode at the proper positions in the resulting code
-   Performance impact of the mitigation: negligible

**[CVE-2017-5715](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-5715)** branch target injection (Spectre Variant 2)

-   Impact: Kernel
-   Mitigation 1: new opcode via microcode update that should be used by up to date compilers to protect the BTB (by flushing indirect branch predictors)
-   Mitigation 2: introducing "retpoline" into compilers, and recompile software/OS with it
-   Performance impact of the mitigation: high for mitigation 1, medium for mitigation 2, depending on your CPU

**[CVE-2017-5754](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-5754)** rogue data cache load (Meltdown)

-   Impact: Kernel
-   Mitigation: updated kernel (with PTI/KPTI patches), updating the kernel is enough
-   Performance impact of the mitigation: low to medium

 

**Disclaimer:** Be careful when running script like these. Please check the script's source code before running.
