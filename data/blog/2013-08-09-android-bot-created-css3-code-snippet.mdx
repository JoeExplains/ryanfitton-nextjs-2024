  I have been playing around with CSS3 recently. As a small test to see if it is possible to design
  with CSS3 I had a goal to create the Android bot in HTML and CSS.
</p>
<p>
  The finished code appears to work fine in modern browsers such as Google Chrome, Mozilla FireFox
  and Apple Safari etc. I have listed the finished code on{' '}
  <a href="https://codepen.io/ryanfitton/pen/xkjeG">CodePen</a> and as a{' '}
  <a href="https://gist.github.com/ryanfitton/6196475">Gist</a>.
</p>
<p>The Android bot will appear like this:</p>

    height="863"

  I have put the finished code up on CodePen{' '}
