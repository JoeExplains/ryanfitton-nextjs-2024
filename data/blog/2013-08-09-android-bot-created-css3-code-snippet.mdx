**Update: I have posted an updated version of this Android bot using CSS3 animations [here](/blog/blog/animated-android-bot-created-in-css3-code-snippet/ "Updated: Animated CSS3 Android Bot").**

I have been playing around with CSS3 recently. As a small test to see if it is possible to design with CSS3 I had a goal to create the Android bot in HTML and CSS.

The finished code appears to work fine in modern browsers such as Google Chrome, Mozilla FireFox and Apple Safari etc. I have listed the finished code on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/ryanfitton/pen/xkjeG) and as a [Gist](https://gist.github.com/ryanfitton/6196475).

The Android bot will appear like this:

alt="android-bot"
width="650"
height="863"
/>

I have put the finished code up on CodePen [here](https://codepen.io/ryanfitton/pen/xkjeG).

See the Pen [Android Bot created in CSS3](https://codepen.io/ryanfitton/pen/xkjeG) by Ryan Fitton ([\@ryanfitton](https://codepen.io/ryanfitton)) on [CodePen](http://codepen.io)

You can also find it on Github as a Gist which can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/ryanfitton/6196475).
