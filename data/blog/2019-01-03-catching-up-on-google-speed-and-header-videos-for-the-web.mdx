First post of 2019! During the holidays I have been catching up on a backlog of video talks which I have been wanting to watch.

I have embedded the videos below:

 

#### HTTP Headers -- The State of the Web

This is a really good video, discussing some of the most common HTTP headers, how they're used and why you should be using them. Andrew Betts also discusses the [HTTP Archive](https://httparchive.org/) project.

 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

#### State of the Union for Speed Tooling (Chrome Dev Summit 2018)

Another good video which discusses the upcoming changes in Google's performance tools such as Lighthouse and Page Speed Insights. A good bit [happens at '08:10′](https://youtu.be/ymxs8OSXiUA?t=490) which mentions the changes to scoring boundaries for Lighthouse -- basically they're raising the bar for how they expect how a 'performance' site should be ranking.

#### Old vs New JavaScript -- HTTP203

Jake and Surma discuss the changes between the methods of writing JavaScript, from the 'olden' days to the new ways of working.
