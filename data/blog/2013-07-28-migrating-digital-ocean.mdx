I have wanted to setup my own server to host websites for quite a while, although looking at the prices from VPS providers such as Rackspace and Linode; the prices range from around \$15 and \$20 a month, too much for what I wanted to pay. My sites don't get enough traffic to justify that amount of money.

Enter [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=fbe5f1c0c98d), for \$5 a month they offer (at the time of writing) 20GB SSD, 512MB RAM, 1TB bandwidth, static IP and SSH access along with support and great community support.

I have been with Digital Ocean for around a month now and haven't regretted it. I host three websites on the server; [ryanfitton.co.uk](https://ryanfitton.co.uk/), [ryanfitton.com](https://ryanfitton.com/) and [bethanyjackson.co.uk](http://bethanyjackson.co.uk/). Each is setup as a virtual host with the domains from my domain provider (1&1) using DNS to translate back to the server's static IP.

The Snapshot and Backup features they offer are great, and have saved me a couple of times for when I have changed a couple of config files.

Overall I would highly reccomend anyone looking for a VPS to look at Digital Ocean.
