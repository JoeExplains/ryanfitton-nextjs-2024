<p>I have wanted to setup my own server to host websites for quite a while, although looking at the prices from VPS providers such as Rackspace and Linode; the prices range from around $15 and $20 a month, too much for what I wanted to pay. My sites don&#8217;t get enough traffic to justify that amount of money.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=fbe5f1c0c98d">Digital Ocean</a>, for $5 a month they offer (at the time of writing) 20GB SSD, 512MB RAM, 1TB bandwidth, static IP and SSH access along with support and great community support.</p>
<p>I have been with Digital Ocean for around a month now and haven&#8217;t regretted it. I host three websites on the server; <a href="https://ryanfitton.co.uk/">ryanfitton.co.uk</a>, <a href="https://ryanfitton.com/">ryanfitton.com</a> and <a href="http://bethanyjackson.co.uk/">bethanyjackson.co.uk</a>. Each is setup as a virtual host with the domains from my domain provider (1&amp;1) using DNS to translate back to the server&#8217;s static IP.</p>
<p>The Snapshot and Backup features they offer are great, and have saved me a couple of times for when I have changed a couple of config files.</p>
<p>Overall I would highly reccomend anyone looking for a VPS to look at Digital Ocean.</p>
