Since my first post of creating a CSS3 Android bot ( [here](https://ryanfitton.co.uk/blog/android-bot-created-in-css3-code-snippet/ "Android Bot created in CSS3 code snippet")) I have wanted to add animated functionality, and in under 15 minutes I did just that.

I have animated the right arm of the Android bot so it simulates 'waving'. I have added a{\' \'} [CodePen](https://codepen.io/ryanfitton/pen/xuikf "A CodePen demo of an animated CSS3 Android bot"){\' \'}and a{\' \'} [Gist](https://gist.github.com/ryanfitton/6258769 "Github Gist link to source code of an animated CSS3 Android bot"){\' \'}below.
