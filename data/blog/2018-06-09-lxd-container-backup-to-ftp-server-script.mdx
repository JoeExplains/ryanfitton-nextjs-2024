<p>As mentioned in my <a href="https://ryanfitton.co.uk/blog/creating-an-lxd-container-on-ubuntu-16-04/">previous post</a>, I would post code for a script which will backup an LXD container as a snapshot, then transfer to an FTP server. The script to do this is below, it has been tested on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.</p>
<p>The steps listed below can be found in my LXC Container backup script collection on GitHub here: <a href="https://github.com/ryanfitton/lxc-mysql-tar-backup-script-collection">https://github.com/ryanfitton/lxc-mysql-tar-backup-script-collection</a></p>
<p>Ensure you have these packages installed:</p>
<ul>
<li>`netcat`</li>
<li>`exim4`</li>
<li>`lftp`</li>
<li>`curl`</li>
</ul>
<p>Save this to a file on your LXD host such as <strong>&#8216;backup-container-snapshot.sh&#8217;</strong>, now change permissions so this file is executable:</p>
```
sudo chmod +x backup-container-snapshot.sh
```
<p>Now edit the file, and ensure these variables match your specs:</p>
<ul>
<li>`GLOBAL_BACKUP_TEMP_SAVEPATH`</li>
<li>`GLOBAL_REMOTE_FTP_LOCATION`</li>
<li>`GLOBAL_EMAIL_TO`</li>
<li>`FTP_SERVER`</li>
<li>`FTP_USERNAME`</li>
<li>`FTP_PASSWORD`</li>
<li>`FTP_PORT`</li>
<li>You may also need to configure passive mode in `FTP_ARGUMENTS` and `CURL_FTP_ARGUMENTS`</li>
</ul>
<p>To run this script, you must pass your LXD container name as an argument, for example:</p>
```
sudo ./backup-container-snapshot.sh 'container-name-here'
```

```
#!/bin/bash

## Usage: backup-container-snapshot.sh

##

## Make the script executable:

## chmod +x backup-container-snapshot.sh

##

## Pass arguments to the script:

## 1: Container Name - Used to target the correct container and create a folder with this name

##

## Run using:

## sudo ./backup-container-snapshot.sh 'container-name-here'

##

## Notes: '/' = Server root folder. '~/' = User's home folder.

##

## Required software libaries:

## 'netcat' Used for checking if a connection can be made to the FTP server

## 'exim4' Used for sending email using the 'mail' command

## 'lftp' Used for sending files using via the 'lftp' command. Allows paths to be created at multi-levels

## 'curl' Used for check if the file exists on the FTP server via the 'curl' command

# Temporary backup location on the server. File will be kept here until FTP transfer is completed.

GLOBAL_BACKUP_TEMP_SAVEPATH='/tmp'

# The backup location on the remote FTP server which the script will use. Each script will create it's own folder within this location.

GLOBAL_REMOTE_FTP_LOCATION='/backup'

# Email address for notification of backups status

GLOBAL_EMAIL_TO='example@example.co.uk'

# FTP remote server connection details

FTP_SERVER=''
FTP_USERNAME=''
FTP_PASSWORD=''
FTP_PORT=21
FTP_ARGUMENTS='-np' # Notes: '-n' = Do not attempt to autologin. '-p' = Enable passive mode.
CURL_FTP_ARGUMENTS='--ftp-pasv' # Curl is used to verify the FTP upload. Notes: '' = Enable passive mode.

# Backup options

NAME="$1" # The Container Name - Used to categorize backups on the FTP server

# Create the save path

FTP_SAVEPATH="$GLOBAL_REMOTE_FTP_LOCATION/$NAME/snapshots" # The path for where the snapshot file should be uploaded on the FTP server.
