This is a follow-up post with an update to the '[Backup Files as Tar.GZ](https://ryanfitton.co.uk/blog/backup-server-files-as-tar-gz-bash-script/)' script.

Some of my similar Backup scripts reside in a a GitHub here: <https://github.com/ryanfitton/lxc-mysql-tar-backup-script-collection>

Version 2.0.0, now adds additional features and bug fixes:

-   Now searches to ensure the required packages are installed.
-   Uses '[lftp](https://linux.die.net/man/1/lftp)' to upload files via FTP. Lftp allows multi-level directories to be created on the server.
-   Renamed configuration variables to make them easier to understand.

``` language-markup
#!/bin/bash

## Usage: backup_files2ftp.sh
##
## Make the script executable:
##   chmod +x backup_files2ftp.sh
##
## Run using:
##   sudo ./backup_files2ftp.sh
##
## Notes: '/' = Backup entire server.
##
## Required software libaries:
##   'netcat'           Used for checking if a connection can be made to the camera
##   'exim4'            Used for sending email using the 'mail' command
##   'lftp'             Used for sending files using via the 'lftp' command. Allows paths to be created at multi-levels
##   'curl'             Used for check if the file exists on the FTP server via the 'curl' command
