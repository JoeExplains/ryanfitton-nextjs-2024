I have recently been developing a piece of work which required the scroll-bars to look flat and clean. I had previously seen Google's Gmail site using the same sort of scroll-bar design which would fit perfectly into the piece of work I creating.

Having a look around the web didn't show much code snippets or tutorials; the ones which I did see where old and outdated. Although I did come across this{\' \'} [Gist](https://gist.github.com/jambu/2004633) Jambu, it works perfectly.

If you are interested in the code, I have forked it on Github{\' \'} [here](https://gist.github.com/ryanfitton/6191707) and embedded it below.

Can't see this Gist properly? View it on line{\' \'} [here](https://gist.github.com/ryanfitton/6191707).
