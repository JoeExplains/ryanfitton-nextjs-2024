  Since re-developing my{' '}
  <a title="Portfolio" href="https://ryanfitton.co.uk/portfolio/">
    portfolio
  </a>{' '}
  for this website, I found that the media picker script which I was using to select portfolio
  images should be updated.
</p>
<p>
  Originally the first version of the script was using the old WordPress{' '}
  <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/ThickBox">Thickbox modal</a>. Since WordPress 3.5 it has been
  possible to use the{' '}
  <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_3.5#Highlights">new WordPress modal</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Although I found it difficult to find any documentation, eventually I was able to implement the
  new modal into my image picker script which I was using for Portfolio images.
</p>
<p>
  The script I use is run as a custom META Box in a Custom type post. The JavaScript code below is
  used to allow the WordPress 3.5 modal to open up when a button with a class of
  &#8216;upload_image_button&#8217; is clicked.
</p>
<p>
  <script src="https://gist.github.com/ryanfitton/5744858.js"></script>This actual code was adapted
  slightly from a{' '}

    blog post by Mike Jolley
  </a>
  . I had to make the modifications to the code because I had areas for three images to be selected
  and did not want to have a mass amount of code for each upload button. Instead this code which I
  amended from Mike Jolley will cleverly work out where the image URL should be placed dependant on
  which upload button you have clicked upon. Below is the HTML code which is used to display the
  form elements in the Custom META box.

  I cannot thank Mike Jolley enough. If you found his code useful then I highly recommend you visit
  his <a href="http://mikejolley.com/">website</a> and thank him yourself.
