These instructions offer assistance with enabling/disabling Hyper V in Windows 10. I have found it necessary to disable this service for use with Virtaul Box, then re-enabling it for Docker.

To disable Hyper V in Windows 10 (e.g. for use with Virtual Box):

1.  Ensure virtualisation is supported by your CPU and enabled in the BIOS

2.  Disable Hyper V for Virtual Box: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-client/application-management/virtualization-apps-not-work-with-hyper-v](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-client/application-management/virtualization-apps-not-work-with-hyper-v)

3.  Disable HyperV in Windows Add/Remove Features

4.  And run this in PowerShell with Admin privellages:

    ``` language-markup
    bcdedit /set hypervisorlaunchtype off
    ```

5.  Restart PC

To re-enable Hyper V in Windows 10 (e.g. for use with Docker):

1.  Ensure virtualisation is supported by your CPU and enabled in the BIOS
2.  Enable HyperV in Windows Add/Remove Features
3.  And in Power Shell, with Admin privellages:
    1.  ``` language-markup
        bcdedit /set hypervisorlaunchtype auto
        ```

    2.  ``` language-markup
        Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Hyper-V -All
        ```
4.  Restart PC
