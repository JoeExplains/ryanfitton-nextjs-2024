This was new to me; Google OptiScore is a new tool within your Google Ads portal which will suggest improvements which can be made across your whole account or individual campaign levels.

The suggestions provided by OptiScore should improve your Ad performance for your site.

I watched a recent video provided by the Partners team at Google from their '[Elevenses Livestream](https://events.withgoogle.com/elevenses/)'.

This information was really useful to me, because of this I have embedded the recorded video from the session below and added my notes:
