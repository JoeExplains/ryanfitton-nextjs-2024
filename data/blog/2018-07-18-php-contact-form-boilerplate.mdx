Every now and again, there is a need for a simple HTML site which does not need the bloat of a CMS.

However, these sites usually require a contact form, so to prevent the need of creating a new PHP form each time and re-downloading the [PHPMailer](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer) library, etc. I have uploaded an PHP contact form boilerplate to a Github repo [here](https://github.com/ryanfitton/contact-form-example).

The repo is free to use and share.
