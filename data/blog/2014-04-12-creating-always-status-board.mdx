I have wanted my own always-on Status Board, ever since I installed Panic's [Status Board app](https://panic.com/statusboard/) on my iPad I decided it would be better to have a dedicated device to display the information.

Buying a new iPad just as a Status Board would be overkill, however I did have a spare cheap 7â€³ Android tablet which I bought a couple of years ago.

I set out to find a frame for the tablet. I gutted the tablet out from it's original casing and removed the touch screen, with only the internal circuitry and screen left I placed the components into an unused digital photo frame case, though the plastic frame had to sanded down with a [Dremel](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0078LENZC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=B0078LENZC&linkCode=as2&tag=ryanfittoncou-21)  so the screen would fit.

Once the components were installed into the photo frame casing I attached a [USB OTG](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0064GZAIQ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=B0064GZAIQ&linkCode=as2&tag=ryanfittoncou-21)  cable to the Micro USB port so I could use keyboards and mice. These would only be needed when setting up the device because the touch screen has been removed.

The Status Board itself is running a PHP web app built using Twitter Bootstrap and LESS. I wrote custom PHP functions to retrieve information such as time, RSS feeds and weather data. The software runs an AJAX call every 9 seconds to refresh the screen with up-to-date data.

Because I was using a cheap Android Tablet, it meant the screen was a low resolution. It doesn't look great but still functions well.

I'm using an Android app called [Power Toggles](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.painless.pc) which allows me to lock the screen rotation and set the display to always-on.
