  I have wanted my own always-on Status Board, ever since I installed Panic&#8217;s{' '}
  <a href="https://panic.com/statusboard/">Status Board app</a> on my iPad I decided it would be
  better to have a dedicated device to display the information.
</p>
<p>
  Buying a new iPad just as a Status Board would be overkill, however I did have a spare cheap
  7&#8243; Android tablet which I bought a couple of years ago.
</p>
<p>
  I set out to find a frame for the tablet. I gutted the tablet out from it&#8217;s original casing
  and removed the touch screen, with only the internal circuitry and screen left I placed the
  components into an unused digital photo frame case, though the plastic frame had to sanded down
  with a{' '}

  so the screen would fit.

  Once the components were installed into the photo frame casing I attached a{' '}

  </a>{' '}
  cable to the Micro USB port so I could use keyboards and mice. These would only be needed when
  setting up the device because the touch screen has been removed.
</p>
<p>
  The Status Board itself is running a PHP web app built using Twitter Bootstrap and LESS. I wrote
  custom PHP functions to retrieve information such as time, RSS feeds and weather data. The
  software runs an AJAX call every 9 seconds to refresh the screen with up-to-date data.
</p>
<p>
  Because I was using a cheap Android Tablet, it meant the screen was a low resolution. It
  doesn&#8217;t look great but still functions well.

<p>
  I&#8217;m using an Android app called{' '}
  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.painless.pc">Power Toggles</a> which
  allows me to lock the screen rotation and set the display to always-on.
