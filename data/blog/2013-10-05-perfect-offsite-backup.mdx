  Over the last couple of years I have begun storing more and more data on my computers, I regularly
  perform a backup of files and full system images every month. I currently store my backups on two
  1.5TB and a 400gb external hard drive, you may say that storing backup data on that amount of hard
  drives is obsessive however I beg to differ. What if one hard drive fails? or if another is
  damaged because of a fire or theft? at least then I will have other hard drives in which my data
  is safe.
</p>
<p>
  Recently though I have been thinking of other ways to store my backups. Currently I keep the two
  1.5TB drives in my home and the 400GB drive is kept in the garage, not so good if my property gets
  burgled. Therefore I was considering paying for a small-self store locker or online storage,
  although with self-storage costs starting around £20 a month and online storage around £10 a month
  that was a little out of my price range. And how could I trust someone else with the keys to my
  data?

  After reading an article online titled &#8220;

    How to Get Easy Offsite Backup On a Budget
  </a>
  &#8221; by John C. Dvorak, he stated his backup solution was just to have a couple of external
  hard drives in the back of his car. This got me thinking further; why shouldn&#8217;t I just do
  the same thing? It was a simple enough task, all I had to do was purchase a{' '}

  then keep it somewhere safe in the car so it wouldn&#8217;t rattle around or be visible to passers
  by.
</p>
<p>
  And that was exactly what I did. I also decided to get hold of a{' '}

  to keep the drive in, then an{' '}

  to wrap the hard drive. This has been my backup process for around a year now and during that time
  I haven&#8217;t experienced any issues, currently I have four external hard drives to backup to;
  each drive has Serpent-Twofish-AES encryption on a{' '}
  <a href="http://www.truecrypt.org/">TrueCrypt</a> container file.
</p>
<p>
  The only decide to having four backup drives is the time it takes to backup each one, although if
  that is the price I have to pay to keep my data secure and safe then I don&#8217;t mind that.
