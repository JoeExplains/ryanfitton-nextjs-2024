This is a follow-up to the current stock image and video websites I use.

My original post is from 2016, you can view it
[here](https://ryanfitton.co.uk/blog/free-stock-image-websites/).
Overtime the websites that offer these resources can become defunct and
new providers become available -- my goal with these types of posts are
to help other people and also become a go-to list.

**Note:** This list was last updated February 2019. I also sugegst you
always double-check the license for any changes when using these stock
resource sites.
