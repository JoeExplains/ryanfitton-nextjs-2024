Here is a neat trick which I've found: using a tool by Google named Docs
Viewer you can embed PDF (Or office and Postscript) files into a webpage
to be viewed on screen, even without a PDF reader plugin installed in
the user's browser.

Simply use the snippet below and change where
`your_document_here`{.language-html} is mentioned twice with a full URL,
e.g. https://example.com/doc.pdf.

``` language-html
<object data="your_document_here" type="application/pdf" style="width:100%; height:700px">
<iframe src="https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=your_document_here&embedded=true"></iframe>
</object>
```
