**Update:** A related post regarding my network rack is available here:
<https://ryanfitton.co.uk/blog/home-network-setup-whats-in-my-rack-2019/>

When I moved into my new house, I knew that I wanted hard-wired Ethernet
networking in every home. Ethernet cables provide much faster speeds
than Wi-Fi and are much more secure.

I wanted the cables to future-proof my house, so I decided to go with
Cat6 cables throughout. All of the
[cabling](https://www.blackbox.co.uk/gb-gb/fi/1235/13221/GigaTrue-CAT6-550MHz-UTP-LSZH-Bulk-Cable/),
wall
[outlets](https://www.blackbox.co.uk/gb-gb/fi/1250/13210/LJ6C-Adapters,Face-Plates-and-Back-Boxes/)
and [keystone
jacks](https://www.blackbox.co.uk/gb-gb/fi/1250/12024/GigaTrue2-CAT6-Jacks/)
were purchased from [Blackbox](https://www.blackbox.co.uk/gb-gb/) -- I
decided if I was to do this work, then I should buy quality components,
I found Blackbox to have some of the best quality components I could
find.

Here are some images of the cable:

sizes="(max-width: 179px) 100vw, 179px"}](/static/img/blog/2016/12/home-network-cable-2.jpg)

In total there are 21 runs of cable with 6 POE ports:

-   Living room: 8 ports (2 ports is POE, for IP phone and exterior IP
    camera)
-   Under stairs cupboard: 2 ports
-   Kitchen: 2 ports (1 port is POE)
-   Office/Study: 4 ports (1 port is POE, used for IP phone)
-   Master bedroom: 2 ports
-   Attic: 2 ports (Both are POE. Connections for WiFi access point and
    cable to run to the garage)
-   Garage: 1 port (This port is POE and is connected to one of the
    ports in the attic. Within the garage, this is fed into a small
    patch panel and is connected to a switch and IP camera)

### The installation

It was relatively easy to install the cabling, although I had to make
sure everything was planned, which meant;

-   Knowing the placements of each wall outlet
-   Where to run each cable
-   If the walls were hollow to enable the cables to be routed behind

I had to lift some floorboards on the first floor and in the attic as
this was the route I planned to run the cable. Because the house is
fairly new (10 years old), the floorboards used long pieces of chipboard
rather than the standard panel boards we usually use in the UK.

After running the cables in place, I routed them into the understairs
cupboard. I found using a '[Cable
Rod](https://www.amazon.co.uk/ACCESS-electricians-Blue-Spot-Tools/dp/B01L4QBEGC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=ryanfittoncou-21&linkId=d343a2454773a0050593df580fbf4861)'
was the easiest way to pull wires through the walls.

One important thing to do is to always number each cable run at both
ends, this will make testing much easier.

Some images of the installed wall outlets (Garage: black external CAT6
Ethernet cable into small patch panel, attic: POE Ethernet outlets,
Living room: 6 Ethernet outlets, Satellite and Coaxial outlets. The
Virgin Media outlet connects to a Satellite cable which goes into the
understairs cupboard):

### Testing the installation

Each of the wall outlets had to be tested. Luckily everything worked
fine and only a couple wires on the patch panel had to be re-done. I
decided to use the [T-568B wiring
scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIA/EIA-568#T568A_and_T568B_termination)
as this is the industry standard.

I recommend using a [testing
tool](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B01M0KVLA0/ref=as_li_ss_tl?psc=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=ryanfittoncou-21&linkId=e4e35c4a360868ac8ad7468be7bce9c5)
and good quality [KRONE punch-down
tool](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Draper-40417-Punch-Down-Tool/dp/B000Q5KLN0/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&qid=1481802785&sr=8-1&keywords=krone&linkCode=ll1&tag=ryanfittoncou-21&linkId=c651e4cf8bba2f4a83b7729e5c3615c4)
to ensure you don't have any issues.

### What is in the rack?

I purchased a new short depth 6U rack cabinet. It wasn't already
pre-built so I spent some time building it and marked out where I wanted
my equipment.

From top to bottom there is:

-   [Surge protected
    PDU](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Dynamode-Horizontal-Switched-Distribution-Protection/dp/B0080OISQQ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&qid=1482611498&sr=8-1&keywords=pdu&linkCode=ll1&tag=ryanfittoncou-21&linkId=75a88d78459127366b93404c74adbd44)
-   Bristle plate, this is where the cables come in from the understairs
    patch panel
-   HP ProCurve 24 Port Gigabit Switch ([1800-24G
    J9028B](https://h10057.www1.hp.com/ecomcat/hpcatalog/specs/provisioner/05/J9028B.htm))
-   TP-Link 8 port Gigabit POE switch
    ([TL-SG1008PE](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00CGY449G/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=ryanfittoncou-21&linkId=467bf8d110d11abde970e26e0ca67e34))
-   Other non-rack devices:
    -   TP-Link wired Gigabit VPN router
        ([TL-R600VPN](https://www.amazon.co.uk/TP-LINK-TL-R600VPN-SafeStream-Gigabit-Broadband/dp/B006TTBYEM//ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=ryanfittoncou-21&linkId=e7b3b7fad62d832809580d56d9094a82))
    -   Virgin Media Super Hub 3.0

As you can see from the photos below, the patch panel which terminates
all of the wall outlet cables is not included in the rack -- Instead I
mounted the patch panel using a [Startech 1U wall mount
bracket](https://www.amazon.co.uk/StarTech-com-19-Inch-Vertical-Equipment-RK119WALLV/dp/B001YHUX2I)
installed into the access panel I fitted. All of the wires terminate
here and then fed into the rack using additional [CAT6 patch
cables](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00VC03GNU/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&psc=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=ryanfittoncou-21&linkId=8c4ae9d76029b780df74c1da22429243).

### Final notes

The results of this work has been shown in an increase of transfer
speeds. I can now also take and receive calls in two rooms and the
garage and transfer data quickly between streaming boxes, computers and
the server.

The work has been tough to integrate the cables into a newly built home
like mine, but if you have the opportunity to run cables in new build
home then you should do so!
