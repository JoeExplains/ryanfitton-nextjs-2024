One of the most common speed testing services for Internet connections
is [Ookla's Speedtest](https://www.speedtest.net/), and more often than
not your ISP will either throttle your connection, or their network will
slow down at peak times.

Because of this, I wanted to make sure I am receiving the full
connection speed which I am paying for.

I went looking for a solution and immediatly came across
[Speedtest-CLI](https://github.com/sivel/speedtest-cli) by Matt Martz.
This repo allows you to perform Speedtests through a command line
interface.

But I was still looking for some sort of tool which could convert these
results to a CSV file, so a new row can be appended to the file each
time a test was run. Again, I went searching and came accross the
fantastic
[Speedtest-CLI-Extras](https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/speedtest-cli-extras)
project by Henrik Bengtsson. This repo allows you to run the Speedtest
CLI command but export the results to a CSV file. This will become
useful to build graphs and check results over time.\
 

#### Notes

So let's start. The installation process is painless, you will require
Python install (python-pip). These installation notes were tested on
Ubuntu 18.04.

These instructions can be found in my Github repo
[here](https://github.com/ryanfitton/speedtest-cli-as-csv-cron).\
 

#### Installation

1.  Switch to the `root`{.language-markup} user:

    ``` language-markup
    sudo su
    ```

2.  Install `speedtest-cli`{.language-markup}, run each line separately:

    ``` language-markup
    sudo apt-get install python-pip
    sudo pip install speedtest-cli
    ```

3.  Download the `speedtest-csv`{.language-markup} script. You will also
    find a
    [copy](https://github.com/ryanfitton/speedtest-cli-as-csv-cron/blob/master/speedtest-csv)
    of this script within the repo which you can, or re-download from
    the original author and make the changes to the file mentioned in
    step 5.

    ``` language-markup
    sudo wget -O speedtest-csv https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HenrikBengtsson/speedtest-cli-extras/master/bin/speedtest-csv
    ```

4.  Now give the file execute permissions:

    ``` language-markup
    sudo chmod +x speedtest-csv
    ```

5.  You will need to edit a line in the file to so that it can be run
    from CRON:

    ``` language-markup
    sudo nano speedtest-csv
    ```

    Find the line `cmd="speedtest-cli $opts"`{.language-markup} and add
    `/usr/local/bin/`{.language-markup} before it so it reads:

    ``` language-markup
    cmd="/usr/local/bin/speedtest-cli $opts"
    ```

    save the file and exit.

6.  Next move `speedtest-csv`{.language-markup} to
    `/usr/bin/`{.language-markup}:

    ``` language-markup
    sudo mv speedtest-csv /usr/bin/
    ```

7.  Create a folder for where your .csv file will be saved, I am saving
    mine within `/cron/speedtest/`{.language-markup}, but change this
    for whatever you'd like:

    ``` language-markup
    sudo mkdir -p /cron/speedtest
    ```

8.  Generate the CSV header:

    ``` language-markup
    sudo speedtest-csv --header >> /cron/speedtest/speedtest.csv
    ```

9.  Add to the CRON:

    ``` language-markup
    sudo crontab -e
    ```

10. Add the following line to the end of the file, this example is
    daily, ever four hours:

    ``` language-markup
    0 */4 * * * speedtest-csv >> /cron/speedtest/speedtest.csv
    ```

    save the file and exit.
