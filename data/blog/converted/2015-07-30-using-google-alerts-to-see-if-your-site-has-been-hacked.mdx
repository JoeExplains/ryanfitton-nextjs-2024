Google's Webmaster Blog has recently posted about their #NoHacked
campaign. This campaign is about giving website owners tips and tricks
to ensure they don't fall victim to a cyber attack. You can read about
the campaign
[here](http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.co.uk/2015/07/nohacked-how-to-avoid-being-target-of.html),
I highly encourage you do -- it gives some great advice.

Part of the advice they gave was about using [Google
Alerts](https://www.google.com/alerts) to notify you if there is any
suspicious keywords on your website.

Using Google Alerts for this task is very simple. Simply go to [Google
Alerts](https://www.google.com/alerts) and setup an alert similar to:

site:example.com "spammy keyword here"

Change 'example.com' to your domain, and change 'spammy keyword here' to
the keyword you wish to be notified of, remember to leave the double
quotes (").

Your alert should look similar to this:
