This is a follow-on from my previous post: '[Backup server files as tar.gz](/blog/blog/backup-server-files-as-tar-gz-bash-script/)'.

The script below works in a similar way as the previous, save as 'backup_mysql2ftp.sh' and fill out the 'Backup options', 'MySQL Connection details', and your email address.

Run the script with `sudo sh backup_mysql2ftp.sh` (make sure the file is executable first).

The databases for the entire server will be stored in a .sql format, then transferred using FTP to the remote server. Once the file has been confirmed it exists on the FTP server, it is deleted from the local server.

``` language-markup
#!/bin/bash

## Usage: backup_mysql2ftp.sh
##
## Make the script executable:
##   chmod +x backup_mysql2ftp.sh
##
## Run using:
##   sudo sh backup_mysql2ftp.sh


# Backup options
BACKUP_SAVEPATH='/root/'                                            # Notes: '/' = Server root folder. '~/' = User's home folder. Used temporarily. Ensure folder already exists.
FILENAME_PREFIX='all-databases_'                                    # Prefix for the .sql file.

# MySQL Connection details
MYSQL_USER='your_mysql_root_username'                               # MySQL Root User.
MYSQL_PASSWORD='your_mysql_root_password'                           # MySQL Root Password.

# FTP Connection details
FTP_SERVER='your_ftp_server'
FTP_USERNAME='your_username'
FTP_PASSWORD='your_password'
FTP_PORT=21
FTP_ARGUMENTS='-np'                     # Notes: '-n' = Do not attempt to autologin. '-p' = Enable passive mode.
CURL_FTP_ARGUMENTS='--ftp-pasv'         # Curl is used to verify the FTP upload. Notes: '' = Enable passive mode.

# Email confirmation details
EMAIL_TO='your_email_address'

**Note:** Using the standard FTP protocol is unsafe, your details will be passed in plaintext. However because Online.net's FTP backup service runs within their own network there is not much risk to myself. I do highly recommend using SFTP or FTPS, both will likely need modification of the script in-order to work properly.

Also see my previous file backup script [here](/blog/blog/backup-server-files-as-tar-gz-bash-script/).
